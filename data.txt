-	The computer was ok but a few months after I bought it the problems began. First the hard drive died, then the screen.I will never buy an electronic used item again
+	I purchase this laptop for my son due to his major in college. I went to Fry's and it was $1199 to $1699, with books and tuition the price was out of my range. My son has a PC and most of his work can be done on it, however, the Mac works better for his design and animation work. He loves it.
+	I love it.. this is small, fast and very attractive. I love to spend time on my mac. .. It's a part of my daily life now..
-	There's a bug in Mavericks that causes the Macbook Air to freeze after the display times out.Apple is not acknowledging the problem.Search "macbook air black screen" to see what i'm talking about.Most likely this will happen to yours as well.I purchased this laptop from Amazon for my girlfriend and she is constantly experiencing the problem, very frustrating and totally unprofessional for Apple to not even acknowledge such a big problem.
-	A warning to those migrating from PC to Mac.  You're in for a ride.  First Mac Air had a faulty track pad.  Second one would not sync with printer in wifi.  Apple says we "don't support wifi printing"  Wish I'd known that.  Meanwhile, can't for the life of me figure out how to use pages or numbers.  In either, a small page shows a menu of all the apps on the machine.  Huh?  Tutorial buttons lead to an ad for the Mac 50th anniversary.  When I do find them, they are pablum and more propaganda for the saintly mac.  Not helpful.  'How to use applications' doesn't include either numbers or pages--who'd want to know about the word processor and the spreadsheet program?  The finder doesn't find templates-- or anything else I looked for-- although I saw them somewhere at some point. No idea how to get back there.  No delete key. I felt like I was in a netherland where my job was to figure out the mystery. Some people like that.  I was trying to write and print a doc.  I wouldn't dare transfer my data to such a system.  Customer service apologized--twice--and the store staff couldn't care less why I returned it or what was wrong.  Worst is I feel really stupid on about a dozen levels.  Because it's the highest rated laptop and everybody loves their Mac!
+	I've been a hardcore windows user all my life and an even harder core android user for 3 years. I never would've thought about getting an iPhone or anything apple until one day i looked up videos online researching iPad for my girlfriend and i got hooked.The "halo effect" happened with me. I got an iPhone and saw how amazing it was and thought "how good could a mac be too"? So i got a macbook. Thought it was great at first but there was a learning curve so i returned it and bought a top of the line hp laptop. Well...It just wasn't the same. Build quality, smooth os, gestures, no bloatware, mac app store. It all adds up and the when i first got the macbook i didn't realize how amazing the whole package was. So i returned the hp laptop and bought a macbook. AGAIN.I could not be happier. Hands down the best purchase i've ever made and  even having been an objective person and "not getting to close and liking things too much", i can see why people swear by apple. I didn't think i could be so impressed with a piece of technology. Seriously. If you get one and it seems overwhelming, go to youtube. Watch tutorials. Ask around forums. When you learn about all the benefits, it's completely worth it
-	Pro:  Good Battery Life.Con:  Hangs and or freezes frequently.  Due to this can't play any half decent games.  Don't touch the touch pad.  It has a mind of it's own.  The touch pad doesn't know whether it's supposed to act like a touch pad on a laptop, or a touch screen on a smart phone, therefore it randomly selects what it wants to do.  Do not rest your palms on the laptop.  You will end up in strange and unknown places within the computer.  For a non-smart phone user, Windows 8 is the most unfriendly program I have ever used.  Just trying to shut down the computer is an ordeal.  Have to find just the right spot in the lower right corner.  Then catch the "settings" button before it disappears.  Now catch the Power button.  Now shut off.  What a pain.  What ever happened to the start/shut down icon?  Everything else most people without Iphones want to do is hidden and you have to figure out how to find it.  All in all I'd say this computer and windows 8 were designed to drive people to the nut house.  I would never recommend this computer to anyone.  Not even those people I dislike!
+	Two years later and it's still going strong. This was my first computer on transition from Windows. A great computer! Apple really knows how to make them.The charger has never once broke on me, after numerous times of it getting tugged on. It has actually saved my computer's life. It's held onto the computer magnetically so it easily disconnects if need be.I've dropped this computer a few times myself and other times it has fallen on my sons tantrum. It has survived. Not a scratch or dent.Just don't go throwing it now!After my pleasant experience using this computer, I'm going to be upgrading to a newer model, probably even an iMac.Make sure to keep it on a flat surface. The bottom of it gets very hot after long use.
-	I had to return it. There was no audio. Poor response from Samsung tech. Put me through ridiculous tests which I knew were a waste of time since the Microsoft tech had already diagnosed the problem. Samsung tech took over 24 hours to return phone call.
-	The hardware of the screen started to come apart within 3 weeks of using this product.The glass started to unstick from the monitor panel at the top edge.
-	I purchased my HP computer with 2 year drop/spill warranty directly from HP. From past experiences with HP (HP pavilion dv9000), I knew that parts were likely to fail within the first two years (motherboard failed in 2nd year). Just outside of the first year, I was in a motorcycle accident and the computer took quite a hit. I broke the screen and I had to use my warranty. First time I called they told me I had no warranty and I spent over an hour proving I did. They assured me that they had resolved the problem. The computer was returned quickly, but only half of the problems were resolved (graphics card did not work on return). So I had to call again. I sat on hold for another hour while they told me that I didn't have a warranty for the second time, even though I could produce the service ticket from my last interaction with them. Even without the customer service experience, I haven't been impressed with the computer. It overheats regularly (needs a table fan blowing on it to run Guild Wars 2 without exceeding 100 degrees C). Overall, very disappointing in HP and their products.
-	Bought my machine at the start of the semester so I had very little time to get up and running. Needed Linux as well as Windows, so I reformatted and installed duel boot, but games kept blowing up! Found out there were no recovery disks! You had to get them from this guy who seemed to be subcontracting from Gateway! Even with the recovery in place, the video was still messed up. Had to subscribe to a driver search service to locate them all. Games run for a little while and then the machine seizes and the hard drive starts making a grinding sound. The Gateway website has precisely "0" (zero) info on how to get support. To this day I don't have a clue how to call or email them. The warranty has a mailing address only.So I had to use it as is. It runs, but the video is wacked. Dropped a grand of precious resources and spent weeks dinking with it when I should have been concentrating on my schoolwork. People complain about Asus and MSI's foreign call centers, but at least they answer the phone. For me Gateway has been a slow grinding hell. The semester is over, I'd like to fix this, but I have no idea how other than to buy a new laptop. I will remember Gateway and tell my friends about them forever.
-	Price may be good but beware. I got a brand new one (well one of the last batches made) and on day two of setting it up the battery stopped working. The laptop would work when plugged in but the battery would not charge and I started getting a warning that if the power was unplugged I would loose all of my work. I looked all over for a replacement battery, since I'm not afraid to take the covers off, but no one has one for sale. I went to the Samsung web site and it says that this laptop model is in "support only" mode. They offered to let me send it in as well with a 14-21 day turn around. They would not just ship me a new battery. IMHO ... it's junk.
+	Good service, the macbook was working in good condition and exactly as described. The SSD hard disk is certainly an improvement over the old type of HDD, the laptop boots and is ready to go in just a few seconds.
+	I see a lot of hate going on when the word DELL is thrown out there.  Look, I have had my Inspiron for over a year with NO problems whatsoever.  Sure, it doesn't have HDMI... and the processor is less than stellar..... what do you expect for the price?  Don't you people read the specs before you buy??Why the four stars.... came with three gigs of RAM, not four. Accessing the RAM (upgraded to 8 gigs) means taking the laptop apart. I wouldn't recommend upgrading unless you are somewhat tech savvy.  The LCD screen is okay, but you can see the pixels rather easily.  It is true, it does have a "cheap" feel to it, but so far not one crack. As for fingerprints??? Forgetaboutit!  The "3D" finish takes care of that and I happen to like it.  I don't like the fact all three USB ports are on the left side of the machine.  Kinda makes it tough on righties when all outlets are on the left.Pros: Bright Screen!! Cheap (price) Runs all of my programs well. It looks good. (have received compliments) The Full Size Keypad is nice... no sticking keys, and very quiet while typing. SD card reader, DVD ROM, AMD Vision all are amazing.  WiFi is picked up very quickly.  More than adequate webcam, and surprising sound from the built in speakers. (as laptops go)  Battery life is not bad... on average I get 2.5 to 3 hours running at full power.  I LOVE the 3D finish. The 4.1 Windows Experience is for running Aero... all other numbers are 5.3 or better. (Including Gaming)  Not too bad for a cheap laptop.  This laptop WILL game, just don't expect high frame rates.Cons: All USB ports on the left side along with the power cord and ethernet port.  The laptop is HEAVY.  The cooling fan sounds like a 747 is taking off, BUT it rarely comes on unless you are really running it hard so not a HUGE con.  The LCD Screen is not the best, in fact I was surprised to see the pixels.All in all for the price, it is well worth it.  Just be sure to upgrade the RAM. (4 GIG stick is 24.99 via crucial.)Windows Experience numbers for those who want to know:Processor: 5.5RAM: 7.0 (after upgrade to 8 gigs... 5.5 with standard three)Graphics: 4.1 (bottleneck)Gaming: 5.3Primary Hard Disk: 5.9
-	I used to buy Asus productsd all the time. I recently bought a Zenbook. Great computer, until the power socket went bad. It took two weeks for them to get back to me with an RMA number. Had to pay for shipping, then the service center sent me an email saying they wanted me to pay for shipping back. Got it back, but had other problems.  6 weeks later, I have been able to use it for less than two of them. Their only answer is "Call and get an RMA and send it back for repair. They won't refund or replace it or send me a temporary to use.I will never buy Asus again.
+	I have been using pcs my whole life and i know macs are more expensive than pcs but this machine worth it, i used to have an hp tx2z before and the mother board fried now i know why the pc stands for... piece of crap lol i love my new macbook pro and the os is so clean and easy to use in just one day i could use it very well i really like the win7 but lion is so much better i hope this review can be useful to somebody.
+	i like it...nice overall quality.  great user interface, performance & batt life.  for power users, it's easy to covert from Window based pc.
+	I've had this a while and love it. It boots faster than any PC, tablet, cell phone, whatever. I've had no problems with it AT ALL. I've done all the HP and Windows updates to 8.1 without a hitch. The backlit keyboard and audio are great and the audio is better than most I've heard and great through heapdphones. I got my Wolfenstein: The New Order pre-ordered so we'll see how that runs and maybe I'll update some more. Otherwise, it's got a sweet display, audio, and boots fast fast fast! Runs as smooth as anything and I was a field support tech for years and built many of my own systems for myself and businesses and this one is really good. I had one question for their customer service and got plenty of prompt information that was very respectable and sincere. Nice!
+	I got the glossy model, base configuration and will upgrade through third parties.  Very satisfied so far.  Feels like the sturdiest, best designed laptop I've ever owned.My only complaint is that as of today (09/19/2011), Amazon's product description states that "This Mac comes pre-installed with OS X Snow Leopard, but you can order a free upgrade to OS X Lion..."  In fact, it ships with Lion pre-installed.  Dozens (if not hundreds) of major 3rd party applications have yet to announce compatibility with Lion, so this can be a significant issue for quite some time.  Amazon is not "set up" to do something as simple as send a customer an OS install disc to fix a problem clearly caused by their own product data.Long story short, I did call Apple and, as it's still under warranty, they dropped a Snow Leopard disk in the mail and will be here in 2-3 days.I requested that Amazon change the product description, so I'll update this review as soon as it's published.
+	Product received as described. Perfectly new condition. All the gadgets in the house are Apple, so saying anything about the choice of the product is pointless.Thank you
-	I never write reviews, but feel strongly that my story should be known. It exceeds any reasonable expectation of product reliability and decent customer service. Do not support Asus.UX31A notebook problems (purchased in July 2012):3/30/13 - will not boot. Sent in notebook for repair, spending $90 for shipping. Received back 4/11. SSD and MB replaced.4/16/13 - despite trouble-shooting efforts, system continues to sporadically freeze after several minutes of use. Sent in notebook for repair (this time paid for). Received back 4/30. SSD, MB, and thermal module replaced.5/1/13 - AC adapter has failed. Ordered replacement charger, still yet to receive. In the meantime, purchased a generic for $40.5/13/13 - will not boot, continue to receive BIOS screen at power on. Sending in notebook AGAIN.Four issues over a month's time, and yet Asus has refused to replace my notebook nor take any other action beyond the timely (and incomplete) repair procedures to turn around my experience.I have made over 15 calls to support and spoken to over 5 supervisors with no continued effort of service. I had to call three times in one day because the RMA generation system was down. Another time, I had to call twice because I failed to receive my service information via email. Most recently, I had to call back because a supervisor told me he would call me that day with a status update on my charger and never did. There has been no concern for the quality of its products or service. Do not support Asus.
-	The laptop is fabulous and I want to love it Soooooo Much.  The screen is the best I've ever seen in 13" and I'm fighting to get one that works.HOWEVER< I'm returning my second until because the keyboard key's do not all work.  There is just no living with this and plants a LOT of doubt in this laptop.I would suggest getting the 3 year warranty because I find it hard to believe this lasting long with these quality control issues.
-	I started a new job in January and they gave me the Lenovo S230u Twist. My new boss said it would be great for presentations and it's very flexible and that the company will be giving their sales people this product in the future. Do not buy this machine! Yes, it does rotate and you can make presentation with it but you can do the same thing with a normal laptop for less money!The keypad is the worst in the industry. It's upside down where the left and right buttons are near the keyboard not your thumbs. The corners of the mouse pad can be pressed but the pressure is inconsistent and the cursor is constantly moving around by itself.I own a Samsung Note 10.1 and it outperforms the twist hands down. The Note's screen is too small for more than one-on-one presentations however. But I have eliminated my paper notepad and do everything electronically.The Twist has a touch screen but doesn't offer a stylus for handwriting, something I love about the Note. All you end up doing is getting the screen dirty touching it. The screen resolution is poor as well. If the Twist did handwriting recognition I could live with the warts it has, but it doesn't.The Twists case has a matte black or grey finish and it sucks up finger oils and constantly looks dirty. Don't eat or snack while working because whatever you eat will end up on the case or mousepad. Bad design.The Twist can swivel. So what? Turn a normal less expensive laptop around and you can accomplish the same thing.The Twist crashes randomly. I don't know if it's because of Windows 8 or the unit itself but it's feels like the old school pc's that would just crash for no reason.The keyboard is weird as well. The delete key is above the backspace key. Not well thought out at all.This machine gets an "F-" for form, function, and price.Buy something else.
-	I order a laptop that was suppose to have a Windows 7 operating system and they ship a Laptop with Windows 8 and refuse to take the computer back and refund the money.
-	internet function did not work, they repaired and sent back still not working. then used the excuse that the warranty time had expired. whats worse is amazon sided w the seller and stuck me with a laptop. i would seriously consider that your options are limited buying any electronics from amazon and look to a retailer like best buy for you purchase. i am shocked at how cut throat the a-z program is. i was not even consulted for my side and had at least 10 emails with the seller including him saying he "fixed" the problem. buyer beware.
+	my first computer i ever use is a mac desktop when i was in 1 grade before i use pc desktop and my own pc laptop, so after i own my own pc laptop it broke down and it freezes a lot, but it last for 7 year i got sick of it. So i decide to buy a new Laptop mac book pro for gaming and music and movies, and its a lot better, faster when it load. but i still need to remember all the basic setting on a mac and new software like the OS X LION.....so the good thing about the mac book pro is that all your data like music, picture and other stuff from a PC, can be transfer to the Mac book pro if your using windows xp, vista, and 7.
+	The 13 inch MBP 2010 was my first mac and I thought it was the best laptop I ever used. Recently I got a special deal on the MBP 15 inch 2011 and decided to upgrade although the price of this thing is quite  high. Right away I busted this thing open, took out the DVD drive and installed a INTEL 120 GB SSD drive in it's place. Now I have 2 drives. The SSD is for OS X + software and the 500 GB spinning HD is for video since I use this to edit HD video H.265 filesAll I can say is that it made quite a difference after the switch from 13 inch. Running Premiere CS5.5 is much more spaced out and comfortable on the 15 inch. Much faster processor too.Internally the MBP 13 uses 1 fan and a small speaker attached to the main board. The 15 inch has 2 fans and 2 real speakers. There are other additions but you can look at apple's site yourself if you want to compare the models.With the SSD drive installed, my applications load instantly and everything is faster than a Macbook Air.Although I was loyal to Windows and PC all my life, I can now tell you that the average user would fall in love with OS X Lion compared to using Windows. Windows is sloppy, virus prone and doesn't operate smoothly with its hardware as Mac products do. I used many windows laptops and they all feel cheap and the trackpad always sucks no matter how expensive the unit is. Lots of people around me switched to Mac after playing with my laptop. A granny can learn to use a new mac in 1 hour while a PC might get tossed out the window.I know you've heard it before but I switched to Mac and don't plan on going back to PC.
+	My second order, one was a started for my Daughter the other a starter for my Mother, both products worked very well even for advanced users, very good packaging!
-	I rarely write any reviews but this time Amazon really got under my skin.  As most people that would be reading this know, the ASUS G55VW-DS71 is a vastly different laptop model from the Zenbook Prime.  Amazon shipped me the wrong laptop!!To add insult to injury because this is a high dollar item, Amazon is insisting I sit around and wait all day for UPS to pick up the return from the house.  As you all know UPS may stop by your house anytime between 8am and 7pm.  Typically we work.  The only way I can do it on my own time and drop it off at the UPS store is to pay for the return myself because they insist it needs shipping insurance.Lovely.  Things to think about when you shop high dollar items on Amazon.  99% of the time they are right on, but that 1% really gets under your craw.
+	I am very pleased with the purchase.  It has performed exactly as advertised.  I bought it primarily to write e-mails "on the go" and it does that very well with the 11 inch screen - being much larger than a smart phone.  But It's also a lot easier to carry around than a full sized laptop.  And because its running Linux (Ubuntu), it's fast, without needing a really heavy duty processor.
-	Update 2/15/2013After receiving the laptop back the second time from their service center, I was hoping I was done with these guys at least till the first year was over. But the battery charger stopped working AGAIN. I also noticed that after they replaced the hard drive they forgot to screw all the screws on the laptop cover (so it's literally had missing screws/screws loose). So I am returning this again to their service center.Update 9/11/2012:Finally received my laptop back from Asus tonight after about 4 weeks (8/17-9/11). I had two problems. The power adapter failed and the computer would randomly reboot and checkdisk would freeze at 13% indicating serious hard drive issues. After all this wait, they just sent me back my laptop with a new power adapter. Their manifest doesn't even mention my second (more critical) issue with the hard drive and sure enough, Checkdisk again freezes. What a horrible company and what a horrible computer. I am glad that during the 4 weeks I bought a real laptop now that it seems I have to deal with Asus some more so hopefully they will actually fix the stupid thing or replace it.Cannot re-emphasize enough the need to buy this from a place that can replace this within the first month so you don't have to deal with Asus' slow incompetent service that took about a month to send me a new charger. Will now email the customer service rep who keeps answering people's reviews here to see if I can escalate.Original Review:Buying this product seems like buying a lotto ticket. Sometimes it works, but often it does not or stops working in the first week or so.I bought this from another site which at the time had a better deal than amazon. I read all the reviews so I fixed the touchpad issue etc. But within the first week the zenbook would stop and reboot randomly or would not shut down. I called customer care and after some time I just reformatted the whole computer and it started working mostly but still would randomly (though rarely) reboot. CHKDSK would freeze midway indicating a hard drive problem. Then the charger stopped working.The computer (and the charger) look nice and fancy but I have never had so much problem with any electronic equipment from the start. I finally shipped my Zenbook back 2 weeks ago and it has been in the shop for the last 10 days (depreciating as we speak while "waiting for parts").The disadvantage of buying this over an apple Macbook air is that with Apple you can just take it to the apple store and they deal. With this product, you just have to deal with mail etc. and from the sound of other reviews and my experience with two separate portions of the product failing, it seems that you need pretty good support since the product is commonly defective.It did look nice though for the very brief period that it seemed to function. Now I am seriously considering buying a cheaper not so sleek laptop for actual use(from any of the previous companies I have bought laptops from like Sony or Toshiba) which at least functions.I wish I had bought this from Amazon so I could have easily returned it without having to wait on service from the get go.I will update this review when and if they can fix my laptop. Hopefully the price won't drop too much by then so I won't feel like a fool.P.S. they don't even extend the warranty for the time your computer spends away from you in the shop.P.P.S. I find it interesting / Sad that many of the reviewers (even the positive ones) have had to ship their zenbook back for repair/ replacement within the first couple of months.
-	This thing is the sleekest, most beautiful and lightweight piece of useless garbage I have ever seen.It's got this awesome facial recognition feature for login that doesn't know who I am after a month of daily logging in and taking a new snapshot of me for its huge database of one user.It's got a nice little input pen for the touchscreen, since a 13 inch touchscreen in 1080p is too fine for anyone's finger unless they are a newborn baby. So it comes with a nice little stylus that you have to keep track of like a regular bic pen (cause I never ever lose those... I buy several dozen a year just to hoard them) and there is no where to slide it into on the body of the PC for safekeeping.The half size keyboard is exactly half as useful as a real keyboard. The tiny trackpad is just useless enough to make you glad you kept track of the stylus.The screen has exactly one angle when the damn thing isn't in tablet mode. I don't know what that angle is optimal for but so far I haven't found a comfortable sitting position I can view the screen from.So far this thing is next to useless for:MasturbatingEmailingSkypingAccountingSpreadsheetsEven casual web browsing is a pain in the ass since tiny links are near impossible to click.The rear camera is decent though so if you want to take crappy pictures with the world's most awkward camera then I guess it's a good buy.Oh, and the battery life is decent so it will last for all the extra time you spend on simple tasks that would be much faster on a real piece of hardware.If the screen angle was adjustable at all I would dock it to a regular mouse and keyboard but as it is it's just 100% useless for me, props to Amazon for a good return policy, and congrats to Sony for putting a huge amount of effort into a product that misses the mark in almost every meaningful way, creating a high performance machine that is nearly impossible to interact with.
+	I know it seems as if I am writing this review a little late, but I just want to say this is perhaps the best computer I've ever purchased. I bought it way back in late 2006 and to this day it's still thriving. I am surprised it has lasted me from high school through my college career with few problems.
-	I really liked the idea of a 13 inch, 1080p screen. Bought it despite some bad reviews. On usage did not like the keyboard or the touch-pad. Last week the some of the keys stopped working. Now I have to send it for repairs.
+	This isn't the greatest laptop, but for $400, it's a good bang for the buck! Obviously not a good laptop for gaming (as other reviews have mentioned), but it is a nice choice for those who want to write some documents, email, and surf the web. I've had no problems with it so far besides the occasional crash(I've had the computer since May), and although it does not have HDMI, I easily fixed that by just taking advantage of its VGA/RGB output. Also, you might want to know that this PC does not support bluetooth, so if you use bluetooth headsets etc, like me, then I would just purchase a bluetooth adapter (there's a couple for less than a dollar here on Amazon).  Overall if you want something for daily casual use, this laptop is a great bargain and a product I would personally recommend!  - Ryan S
-	very heavy laptop...difficult to carry with one hand. the weight should be specifically mentioned. it weighted almost 4 kg. disappointed
+	This computer was bought for my husband while he is laid up and it has pretty much done what he needs it to do.  It is nice to be able to have the portable computer.
-	I love the 13" screen. No noisy fan, no cooling ports on bottom to worry aout blocking, never hot, quick start-up. Changed to Windows 7. After having for a few months the keyboard is strange and when typing cursor jumps around and you have to constantly follow what you are typing or next thing you know you have deleted part of your text or started typing in the middle of what you have already entered. My wife has an Aspire S3 that looks identical except with Spanish keyboard. Yet, when she uses mine same problem with cursor jumping around.Note price fluctuates dramatically so one has to watch daily. Mine from Amazon was $426 incl. shipping.My MacBook Air arrives next week and can not wait to sell this Acer Aspire S3.
-	This computer had issues right out of the box and kept getting worse until finally last week it just blue screened out and now won't function. I'm going to try a full system reboot, but if that doesn't work, it's going back, even if I don't get a full refund. I'll sink my money into a Dell or an Apple, instead.I was told HPs were better than Dells, but that's not the case with this laptop. Aside from all the problems with Windows 8, the touch pad on this always switched between hyper-responsive and non-responsive. Sometimes the system would boot quickly, sometimes super slow. I would get "high system use" warnings right out of the box, before anything was even processing. The Norton software that came with it worked sporadically, but wouldn't even finish a full scan most of the time.It's a lightweight and attractive design, but it stops there. I suppose it's possible I just got a lemon, but I've read other, similar complaints for this laptop. I got burned-- don't take a chance and get burned, too!
+	This is a great laptop! I have an iMac and really needed something portable when I travel and go on location. This macbook pro is perfect. Does everything I needed it to do and is great for tethering my camera for photoshoots. Although the screen is a tad to small for some real heavy photo editing, I love using it as a review screen for my clients to see their work. It was all about portability for me so this was a perfect fit. Everything works just how it should!  just make sure you upgrade to 8 gigs of ram to really get the true power out of this machine. It is actually faster than my desktop!
+	Actually i have been very much happy with the product but its the service that makes me feel am cheatedCouple of months back i had to visit the apple service centre due to some problem in my macbook but they said my serial number is not recognised by appleso they asked me to get the bill now i dont have a bill which has my mbp's serial number printed on it,Amazon am looking for a solution for this hope someoneis listening,Please look for the other buyers people
+	I can sum up my review in one word:Superb. No, Extraordinary! No, Awesome! No... well, you get the idea.Maybe i'm over reacting, but i do love this little machine. Its just over the top, the quad core processor breezes through anything i throw at it, and the 4Gb are very capable (though i'm considering upgrading it to 8gb soon). Something that really rules is the video card. So far i've installed several games on it, and ALL of them it runs on very high settings.This is my first Mac, so i had to suffer a slight adaptation period. A very slight period. It took me all 15 minutes to get used to it. It's just so natural!I love tweeking configs and personalizing my computers, and though Mac OS is more rigid with respect to the themes one can put up, its a marvel when it comes to comfort. If you get down and dirty, Exposé and Spaces will rock your world. And the dock is just so much more practical than the standard issue windows bar.Now, compatibility wise Mac OS can seem problematic, however this is just an illusion. This particular MBP packs so much punch that you can literally run windows on it simultaneously without even a hiccup. Virtualization, however, is a must for anyone that needs specialized software (specifically anyone with a CAD oriented program repertoire).Im running Parallels 6, with a Windows XP virtual machine, and it runs all my Engineering programs beautifully (Staad.pro, MathCAD, Civil 3D, Revit Structure, MS Project). There is a Mac version for AutoCAD, but if you already have the windows license, the virtual machine will run it beautifully too. With tools such as "Coherence" you can be using Windows and Mac simultaneously without having to deal with the typical Windows problems.Something i'm loving is the stability. Now, i have been pumping this baby with hard hitting processes since day 1, and it has responded well. Now, don't get me wrong, it did have its standard hangs on certain apps, however the hangs are very "contained", as the OS on a whole remained perfectly stable during these hangs. The apps that would hang, could easily be Force Quit and reopened with no data loss.I've been using video converters for a long time, since i do have preffered formats for video, and this little piece of heaven really cuts down conversion time. There is this little open source app called Handbrake that handles itself pretty well for conversion. Its one of the only apps that i've found that can handle the quad core resources almost seemlessly. Bootcamp is a must if you do heavy gaming. I installed Windows 7 on it and it runs like its native... Better even. I've installed games such as Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Deadspace 2, Starcraft 2, and Just Cause 2. They all run on full graphics without a zinch. I've been really pushing this machine, and so far im extremely satisfied.I've been reading other reviews, and i cant understand some of the complaints. Maybe they got bad units, but then again Apple will replace any defective unit in a flash so it's not really an issue. I dont have any complaints with respect to battery life, i can get the advertised 7 hours, and even push out 8hours if i bump out Airport whilst im using text processors. However when using resource hogs, the battery drains quickly (for instance when running XP simultaneously the battery life goes down to around 3-4 hours. Graphicly demanding programs also drain the battery quickly.If you are looking into this particular model (15" 2.2Ghz Quad Core 4gb Ram 6750 AMD Radeon), then chances are you know your way around computers. My guess is you are probably into graphicly demanding progs as well. So i can vouch for it, and say that it has answered elegantly to any vulgar attempt i've made at maxing it out. If you are not looking for a powerhouse though, i STRONGLY recommend getting one of the mid ranged models.The price tag on this baby was the only cringe-factor... but now, 3 weeks into this enterprise, i can say its definitely worth it. If you can afford it, and you will actually use it at its potential i absolutely recommend it. If you are a casual user, however i recommend something less expensive.Windows users don't be afraid. There are more ways to run windows on a mac than you can shake a stick at... but DO NOT buy this computer just to run windows on it... just get a PC, its cheaper :PSo in short, this laptop is over the top, i strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a powerhouse, but i strongly advise against this particular model for anyone looking for just casual computing. Anyway you go about it, Apple won't let you down. I finally understand why people say "Once you go Mac, you never go back".:D
-	The hard drive crashed within 2 months of owning.  After receiving a new hard drive from Sony and replacing it myself, half the screen turned blue with lines and was unusable.  I sent it in for repairs and was told that it was water damage that caused it and it would cost me $450 to fix.  What a nightmare, $500 down the drain.
+	I am not a gamer or anything, but this can hold it's own-just not the carzy latest games like Far Cry or Max Payne 3..but not many laptops in the price range do.  I paid $600..I do play some 3d games, and the games I want to play work.  If you go to Futuremark's website, and put in the spec for this computer, you shall see that this play 100% of the games at the MINIMUM settings at 71% at MAXIMUM settitngs!  Not bad for $600!  Plus, the backligh keyboard is nice and the fingerprint reader is handy for more security.  It certainly is much quieter than my 7 year old Gateway which just didn't turn on.  I cocluded it was a motherboard or power supply issue-and it was a hassle to get someone to troubleshoot.  I figured I'd just buy a laptop-it's a great machine!  Annd the once reviewer who gaave this 1 star based on lack of "restore" disks..well, that just being ignorant!  Very few..except maybe old skoll Dells game w/ the system CDs.  To base a review on that alone is LUDICRIOUS!!
-	I bought a new one not too long ago...i was able to use it for 4 months and the lcd started to act crazy (purple spots on screen) and it slows down..shipped it twice to dell for repair got it back and after a day i got the same problem again..they sent me a replacement but a refurbished one..the replacement they sent me didnt last 6 months and they told me that its already out of warranty cause refurbished laptops only have 90 days warranty...i bought the new one 10 months ago and then the one year warranty is voided because it was overlapped by the warranty of the refurbished one?..i even have all the info and receipt of my original purchase including the service tags and some other infos of the laptop and my warranty was voided because they sent me a refurbished one which broke after 6 months of light use..its not even been a year when i purchased my new one and dell gave me the redurbished on the 4th month so i still got 2 months  left of my 1 yr warranty...dell have the worst product and customer service ever..note that i dont even use the laptop for gaming and some other stuff that requires higher hardware requirements...
+	If you're looking for incredibly fast processing speeds, a fantastic battery life, and craftsmanship second to none, they you want this MacBook Pro. I'm delighted with it. Leaves PC Laptops miles behind!
+	I was looking for a medium-sized laptop that I could take to college with me. I wanted something that had decent battery life, and one that was able to play most of my video games on at least medium settings. I have a large, dual monitor gaming set-up with a gaming desktop, so I have that to play all my graphic-intensive games on ultra settings, but I wanted to be able to do school work and some play on the go. This laptop performs extremely well. I can play minecraft, league of legends, warframe, etc, on Medium-high settings with no lag. Web pages seem to load faster on this. It's quiet, but the fan does kick in when you switch it to high-performance mode and get gaming.It took me a while to get used to Windows 8, because my desktop is still at 7, but once you do, it isnt too bad. I miss having a regular start button, but they are supposedly coming out with 8.1, a free update that will give you the old functionality. Sometimes I feel like I'm using a tablet more than a laptop.The speakers on this thing are amazing, They have dolby home theater speakers on the front, and a built-in software to control surround sound and what it sounds like with headphones/without headphones. Truly amazing sound. I love it.The battery life is NO where near 5 hours. That is a complete lie. I get maybe 3.5 hrs on "power saver" mode, and maybe 2.5 on "High performance" mode. However, I rarely am without a power outlet, so this isnt too big of an issue to me.This laptop starts up lightning fast, has amazing hard drive space, and a decent amount of RAM which can be easily upgraded.The only thing I've found that bothers me is Skype. Once you sign into the Skype app with one account, you have to log out completely from microsoft and your email, etc, to log into another one. So far, it only lets me download the skype app, and not actual software to use on the desktop. A major pain for me since I have a personal family skype account, as well as a gaming one without personal information. I can't easily switch between them.I did not buy this from Amazon, I bought mine from an actual store for about $80 less.
+	Well, I don't use mac so heavily. But I don't know what's the difference with new mac except the price...lol... It is good enough for my daily work! Love it.
+	I had a computer refuse to boot.  I happened to have very important things running on it that would have required program upgrades to move to a new computer with my backup files.  I found the exact same computer on Amazon, purchased it, had it in 3 days and it took me 15 minutes to unpack, change hard drives and I was back up and running.Great experience all around.
+	I have been needing to replace my old Laptop for some time. I've waited until I really needed it for work, and needed to get one asap. After some searching, to really get the best deals, well, they're almost always online. I've found that for certain types of electronics, there is nothing wrong with refurbished. In fact, in many cases, the slightly older models are built with higher quality products, parts. And have fewer "bells and whistles" type features that can break easily. This Dell was / is surprisingly faster than I anticipated. It's not super heavy or bulky, it's great!! The built in speaker sound is loud enough that I can actually enjoy watching movies on it, or listening to music. The streaming is basically perfect! And the screen (the most important part for me) is large enough that I can sufficiently use this Laptop on the road for more complex software programs, for work. Eventually, I will want to upgrade and get a bigger screen, yada, yada. But this is just what I needed and I trust I will continue to enjoy having it around. I recommend!!
-	I'm using it for less than 6 months. Last month the SSD completely died. After replacing and reinstalling everything it worked. Yeah, for another month.Just now it was stuck on the booting.And I'm using it occasionally.Worst laptop I've ever used.
-	UPDATES: SO, I just sent my 3rd (my THIRD!) Zenbook Prime back to Amazon. I've sent back enough by now that Amazon will no longer permit me to just send it back and overnight a replacement. They actually just told me they're going to refund my money because they figure future replacements would probably also be faulty too. That's how bad it is with this thing. Not sure what I'm going to do next, but I may give the Thinkpad X1 Carbon a whirl. It's really a shame, because for the brief window that my Zenbook did work, it was basically the perfect computer. This is, hands down, a 5-star product - IF it worked. But apparently, it just straight-up doesn't. I really, really want to just order another one, because I'd be so happy if I actually got one  that f$*@ing worked, but I honestly believe that I might have to order ten of these things to have a shot at one working product.Doesn't that make this whole line a lemon? Right? I mean, I've never seen anything like this - a laptop that you can potentially go through a half dozen of without ever getting one that functions properly. I've also never had Amazon tell me that, in effect, the product is so hopeless they're just going to give my money back without even attempting another replacement. I wanted to love this laptop. I really did. I still do. But I just can't keep ordering it over and over again when I have so little faith that I'll ever find one that works. This whole thing is a travesty. I never imagined Asus would allow such across-the-board hardware failure in one of their products. My god.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW (written during the brief time that the original item actually worked):I did a great deal of research when I was shopping for my new computer. I knew I wanted an ultrabook and wanted a Windows machine. That, right there, narrowed it down to the Asus Zenbook Prime, the Samsung Series 9, and the forthcoming Thinkpad X1 Carbon. Even though the shortcomings of the Zenbook Prime are very thoroughly documented and, some say, crippling to the user experience, I took the plunge. I am here to tell you I adore this computer and have zero regrets.First, a very general overview of performance: The thing is fast. Very fast. I am not going to split hairs by comparing it directly in measurables to its primary competitor, the better-respected Series 9, but suffice to say that they're comparable. The 9 is faster booting and faster recovering from sleep, and not by a small margin, percentage-wise, but the Zenbook is so fast to boot and recover I frankly couldn't care less. You are into Windows almost instantly upon pressing the power button.The main selling point of this particular machine is its 1920x1080 screen. It does not disappoint. I am not a fan of LCD technology, even the most advanced IPS offerings: my TV is a Pioneer plasma and my phone has a Super AMOLED+ display. Needless to say, I am spoiled in that regard. However, I can say with confidence that the Zenbook Prime's FHD IPS LCD display is not only gorgeous in its own right, it's probably the best LCD computer monitor I've ever SEEN. Black levels are excellent, colors are shockingly accurate and vibrant, and the level of detail it's capable of presenting is genuinely stunning. The only display on the market superior to this one is Apple's Retina, which, at an even higher resolution and with even better black levels and color gamut, is superior in all regards on paper. But I should note that I've used both and, frankly, the differences are imperceptible in real-world use. My only complaint is that the resolution on this screen is so high, it's impossible to comfortably view most content at 100% size levels. The computer comes pre-loaded with Windows already set to 125%, which works. After that, you'll want to set your preferences in Chrome, IE9, or Firefox, do default all Web pages also to 125%, otherwise you'll find yourself zooming in on literally everything you see. Be aware that some programs don't support different zoom levels right now: like Google Talk, which I ultimately just had to replace with Trillian, because the text was so impossible to read in Google Talk and Trillian would let me make the whole thing bigger.In terms of general real-world performance, this computer leaves nothing wanting. The Core i7 processor is more than adept to do basically anything, you can expand the RAM from 4 GB to 10 GB by inserting a new SODIMM, leaving you with more ram than you'll probably need at any point in this laptop's life. The SSD is adequately sized but comes preloaded with, no joke, probably 60 gigabytes of bloatware. I wasn't able to get rid of much of it just by removing programs; not sure what's eating up all the space. However, when Windows 8 officially launches, I plan to do a fresh install and hopefully reclaim a chunk of that space. The SSD is, itself, a standard size - so you can swap it out with a bigger, faster one if you're so inclined. I stuck with the 128 GB model with the intention of eventually buying a 512 GB aftermarket drive.Finally, I'd like to clear up some bad misconceptions about this computer:1) THE TRACKPAD IS NOT A PROBLEM. Seriously. This is not a bad trackpad. Don't get me wrong - it's not GOOD, either. But if you look around online you'll see plenty of user reviews and professional reviews basically declaring this unit an unusable paperweight because of the horrifyingly dysfunctional trackpad. Yes, when you open the box, the trackpad is horrible. But then all you do is go to ASUS's website, download the updated driver, and download the Beta of ASUS Gesture, and the trackpad is 80% better right there. If you're still not happy with how it works, nothing is stopping you from poopping over to Samsung's website, downloading the Synaptics drivers and installing them to your Zenbook. This will cause the trackpad to behave like any other Synaptics device, which, for the record, is not without its own flaws. I'm happy enough with ASUS's new drivers that I have stuck with them and, actually, the gesture controls are robust and slick. It supports two- and three-finger touch for cycling up and down windows, between programs and pages, and rotating images. Very slick. I will complain that sometimes the amount of pressure and movement required to get the cursor to go where you expect it to is unpredictable, and that the reaction on-screen is not always what you want, but I have never met a trackpad that didn't present you with similar issues from time to time. The point is, this trackpad is by no means precise and helpful, but it is not worse than par for the course, either. It should not prevent you from buying this laptop, that's for sure.2) The other main criticism I've heard of this device is that it's killed by a bargain-basement SSD drive. I can't claim to be an expert on SSD performance, but there is nothing about the user experience here that would suggest that the OEM SSD is holding this thing back significantly. I may change my opinion when I eventually upgrade it to an after-market model that meets beefy performance benchmarks, if that creates a noticeable improvement. But for now - it's an SSD. It blows away any 7200 RPM drive ever, of course, and that's what we're all pretty much used to. Again, like with the trackpad, people have made this sound like a deal-breaker, ad it just flat-out is not. It's fine. Maybe you find yourself wanting to replace it with something faster; that's fine. It's replaceable. But nothing about it has suggested to me that I'll want to.3) Finally, there IS light-bleed at the bottom and side edges of the screen. There's quite a bit of it, actually, and it's eminently noticeable when you start Windows and see the black Windows-logo splash screen. However, it is literally totally unnoticeable in basically every other usage scenario. It only comes out when the outside edges of the screen are completely black and there is very little picture information populating the rest of the screen. Even watching letterboxed movies, it's there, but it's barely noticeable against the backdrop of this panel's gorgeous reproduction of HD video.Some people inevitably come back to the thinking: you know, it's so expensive, and it does have some problems - why wouldn't I just buy a MacBook Air? That is a perfectly valid choice. Indeed, the MacBook Air has NONE of the shortcomings that this laptop does, and the prices are very comparable. But can you get a MacBook Air with a Core i7 for this price? No. Can you get a MacBook Air with the Retina display at all? No. Here, you can have an i7 and a borderline indistinguishable equivalent to a Retina display in a 13.3" ultrabook for very close to the base MacBook Air price. For someone like me, who prefers Windows, that is a no-brainer.
+	I have been a PC tech for over 15 years.I waned a Mac for all along because of it's great quality. Amazon has a great price for this laptop and no sales tax. I finally couldn't resist. Top looks ,feel screen etc. I'd recommend one to my friends.
-	I bought this Sony Vaio after having own othe Vaio laptops for a long time and being worry free.  But with this one, after just six months of use, it just stop working.  Took it to the local authorized Sony dealer and they told me the mother card was damaged and that the repair was going to cost almost the same as this laptop cost me.  Since I Bought it from outside the US, I've been having trouble getting a second oppinion.  Too bad for a product like this one.
+	After spending most of my adult life messing with PCs and working in the industry, I always wondered how the Macs compared to the PC.  Recently, the iPhone came to Sprint and I was able to acquire the iPhone 4S after all these years waiting patiently and buying android phones.  The iPhone hooked me.  After seeing how great the phone was, my curiosity was at an all time high for the MacBook.  I made the plunge via store.apple.com.I thought there would be a massive learning curve going in but to my surprise, everything is simple and straight forward. Things that I thought I would struggle with like finding out the computer name, networking, connecting to a printer, divx codecs, and installing software were all straight forward.  It just works.The hardware is a work of art.  Backlit keyboard is amazing.  My old windows laptop had a light flash down on the keyboard but this is so much better and easy on the eyes.  From a looks standpoint, this blows away everything else excluding the MacBook Air.  Windows just feels old.  PCs feel prehistoric and very dated.At this point, I don't see myself buying or building another PC/laptop.  The only thing I haven't figured out at this point is why I waited so long?
-	Laptop is horrible, Big crack on screen and Webcam was not working.I totally disappointed the way they have published in amazon
+	The laptop work very well me daughter and I really enjoy it very much and hope to enjoy it many more year
-	I didn't setup anti theft technology, it was preinstalled in the laptop and suddenly locked my laptop. I called both SONY and INTEL, they couldn't fix the problem.
+	Let me start off by saying I have always been a pc guy until I purchased my 2010 macbook pro 13' last year and I must say I don't know why I waited so long! I purchased my 13 back in September and about 6 months later I saw the new MacBook pros came out and comparing the specs I felt like I needed to upgrade. I replaced my 2010 Macbook Pro 13 with this and I must say that I am very pleased. The dual core on the 2010 seemed fast but when compared to the i7 quad core the dual core isn't even in the same universe! The 15' is super fast and great at handling multiple apps at once. The new Lion OSX is excellent and apple has added  a lot of things to make this os superb to others. The only drawback is that Apple has axed rosetta which means power pc run applications and games are no longer supported. However I like the fact that if needed you can add windows via bootcamp (if you want to play pc games or need to use apps that are not compatible with macs). The battery life on this laptop is great. I can usually get 6 to 8 hours of life from a single charge depending on what I am doing. Most laptops can only get 3 or 4 max. The battery can actually be calibrated to help get the most out of a charge. Ilife 11 is a great addition with this laptop and apps like iMovie and iPhoto couldn't be easier to use. Portability isn't as good as the 13' but with this computer being pretty much 2x-3x faster that the 2010 13' I'm not complaining. Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase and if your thinking about converting to a Mac, DO IT! You will be very satisfied.PROS1. The processor is a super fast 2.0 ghz quad core i7 great for gaming on bootcamp or on lion (2x-3x faster than previous generations).2. The battery life is great. ( A little less than my 2010 13' mbp but it averages about 6 to 8 hours a charge depending on what I'm doing so I'm not complaining)3. Osx Lion is a great upgrade from snow leopard and does a great job at keeping everything organized and fast.4. Great apps included like Garageband and iPhoto.5. The case looks very sleek, thin, and professional and the backlit keyboard can be super bright or dim depending on how you want it.6. Bootcamp is a great feature that many people may not know used to run windows on your mac if needed. 7. The screen is extremely bright and big and hd videos look crisp and clear.CONS1. Price is a little steep compared to other pc's with the same specs.2. When running windows the laptop can get very warm.3. In the new Lion OSX power pc run apps and games is not supported anymore.
+	We bought this laptop for my mom who is 82.  She's quite computer literate for an old lady!  She's mastered Windows 8 already!  She just needs it for word processing and internet use (yes, she's on FB!) so this laptop is fine for her.  It's a good value for a basic laptop! Not for gaming or anything high-tech, but fine for her!
+	I've had several laptops over the years - both personal n from work... so i wanted something that would really get me excited about owning a laptop and decided apple macbook pro would be ideal -it is!! The picture quality is just amazing and great for chatting online ..again because of the video quality.Initially while buying I was slighly confused about the colour of the laptop so just to let you'll know - its silver (doesn't come in any other colour for this specification). Its comes ready to use so no software installation or any other hassle. It is very intuitive and teaches you a whole new way of computing if you're willing to learn - you can drag n drop almost anything.The packaging was excellent and reached right on time - thanks to amazon prime!
+	The computer was shipped in USPS box with adequate padding.  time  to deliver was reasonable.  Also the system had no battery windows xp and power supply just as it was stated.  the touchscreen did work as stated.  The unit is in great shape for a 2007 machine.  You know.... for the money, it was ,a good deal.  For anyone who wants a low end CF19 that you can bumps up to 4 gig of ram if you want to spend a few bucks more go for it.
-	Had to return. Did not perform as expected.  Return process was very OK.  It was too slow, blue ray did not work.
+	Good value for the money.  Works as advertised.........what few cosmetic problems there were cleaned up readily.  Appears almost new.  If it lasts for a year or more, it will be a great purchase.
+	after years and years having difficulties with PC's, I save some money and buy me a MacBrook Pro. I couldn't be happier, this is the best investment so far, very quick easy to use, almost everything I use to do with Pc's I'm doing it here. I upgraded the memory and it's running as no other PC i ever own, plus I'm using parallels to run some Windows App I need for my studies, so I have the best and I definitely recommend to buy a Mac, you won't regret it :)
+	I just upgraded from the 2011 15 inch 2.0ghz MBP to the 2011 2.2 mostly because of the graphics card upgrade to a full gb. I also installed a new owc 240 gb mercury extreme pro 6g ssd along with 8gb of memory. To me it didnt make a whole lot of sense to spend that much money on extras and not go for the higher end model 15 inch.Ill be honest the 2.0 ghz version with 256mb of vmemory was more than enough and performs very well in comparison to the 2.2 version. Most people would never know the difference if they took the pepsi challenge.I am a label whore however and I couldnt sleep at night knowing there was more out there.The smart move and most cost effective however wouldve been to upgrade the 2.0 version mbp with probably the most stable and most reliable ssd in my opinion on the market and thats the samsung 470. it has a 3gbs data transfer rate so its not as fast as those in sata III and at 6gbps but again the difference in real world computing scenarios is negligible. It isnt however apple friendly and neither are the firmware updates if you have a mac.I wanted the fastest while  still conserving some reliability so an OWC ssd with a five year warranty and excellent customer service and the latest firmware included before shipment was the obvious choice over an OCZ. Both ssds are sata III and have a 6gbps data transfer rate.No other upgrade will make a bigger difference in the performance of your computer than an ssd. Dont waste your money on a substandard apple offering though, there's a lot better offerings in both ssds and memory out there.I will also never purchase another computer through anyone other than Amazon.My first 2011 mbp in 2.2 ghz showed up after riding around in a ups truck in 115 degree Phoenix heat all day...I dont know how hot the inside of the truck was where the cargo is kept but the computer on arrival was nearly too hot to handle with my bare hands, I knew there would be issues.The display was loose and unstable when opened and the battery took a health hit showing just 90% health...unacceptable for a brand new 2000 dollar computer.I had zero problems getting a replacement and a morning delivery time. It was sent and arrived in one business day, and before I could send UPS's goof back to amazon...I was already using my new one. The reliability, discount, plus zero tax always makes me wonder why anyone would buy anywhere else. Any way just my thoughts hope they may help someone.I did take one star for price and the cost of the apple name and like I said I wouldve been just as happy with the performance of the 2.0 ghz version if i werent so neurotic.Just one more quick edit...the free upgrade to lion from apple's website couldn't be easier.
+	I wanted to give it a 5 out of 5 but not having a Antiglare Display is a really big problem. Too bad I couldn't order it with Amazon because they don't carry it ... but point being I've had non-mac laptops before and even without an antiglare screen they weren't as much trouble to handle as the macbook pro. It is really painful to work with the default screen of the macbook pro. Everything else is top-notch.
-	I bought it with one day shipping to my house and that was the best thing that I received, TY Amazon. When I got it the 1st problem I had was with connecting with the wireless router from Linksys that I had to pay a $9.99 fee for tech support. It took 3 - 4 hours to get it working. Then I had problems running videos from Apple with Quicktime and Youtube with flash. Then I ran City of Heroes that worked fine on it to my surprise. The next morning I started up the computer with a nasty blue screen and a system failure message that dump all system memory as well. The computer then put me in safe mode that now video was able to work ??? I called HP about my problems with the blue screen and video problems he instructed me to do a full system recovery on my day old computer. The computer, after reinstall, came up and seemed to work then the HP tech told me to reboot the computer for updates. The computer then got stuck in a system loop and now safe mode couldn't work now. He then told me he needed me to call a senior tech in which I had to call back at a different number, after 1 1/2 of being on hold enough was enough.  HP tech had me on the phone for 5 hours. I bought computers in the pass but between system problems on a day old computer and terrible HP tech service I sent the computer HP Pavilion DV7-2170US 17.3-Inch Entertainment Laptopback for a full refund.
+	Rock star computer. Windows 8 is challenging however it is worth the money.  Dell is the way to go !
+	This product is so good and the price so low that I feel guilty for buying it, like I stole it! :-). It is easy to set up and use, lots of software, quick connect to wireless, runs great! Fantastic product, and Amazon is awesome, as usual!
+	This computer has a realy neat etched design that you can't see in the ads very well. It's a bunch of little circles in different shades of silver and black. Very cool bonus. The screen is very large. The computer is also quite long lengthwise. It seems a bit disproportionate, but that's no big deal. Just prepare to buy a carrying case according to its dimensions. It's just a tad bit slow on the Internet, depending on what kind of Internet you have. Really not that noticeable. There is no physical Wi-Fi switch either (but it does have Wi-Fi). At any rate, all in all a pretty decent computer for the price.
+	This Toshiba came packed with all the bells and whistles I was looking for, but not overloaded with all the extras I didn't.It is super fast with the i7 processor and the 12gb of ram help keep it thinking straight while multitasking.Really cool, brushed aluminum looking outer case and I LOVE the back-lit keyboard for low light situations. The 15.6" size is quite refreshing compared to my old 17" and the computer is very lightweight.It comes ready to go with Windows 7 Pro, which I needed for my business. However, it also comes with the upgrade disks for Windows 8 Pro if I should ever need to upgrade.As with most off the shelf PC's, it comes with a trial version of MS Office on-board, which will allow you to log on to the Microsoft website and purchase the version of your choice.
-	This computer was only 2 months past the year warranty and kept going into sleep mode. Everything had been great before this.  I must've spoken to 5 or 6 different tech support reps, who tried to be as helpful as possible, but kept telling me how many problems this model has. Two reps even said this model had been re-called and when I asked why I wasn't contacted, they retracted the recall statement.  I also had 2 visits from repairmen who fixed the problem but only temporarily.  I also had to pack up the computer and send it back twice but again, the problem kept on.  So, the final result was that it apparently needed a new motherboard but was past the warranty so it would cost me over $700 which was $100 more than what I paid for it! The computer is awful and Sony support (in the end) is worse! Do NOT BUY this computer!!
-	I purchased this laptop in Feb of 2011 for $2300 and the touchpad has not worked properly since then.  It's been 20 months now and 5 or 6 RMA's later.  Just do a Google search for "Asus Touchpad Issues" and you'll come across lots of sites where users complain about the same thing.  Asus is unwilling to do anything each time except to format the laptop and to say it's fixed.  I then get the laptop back and then have reconfigure it all over again to the way I like it, only to find that that it's still junk.I can understand that products can't all be perfect, but Asus should 1) have a recall based on the number of users with problems and more importantly 2) treat their customer fairly.  20 months and they're still promising me it's fixed yet again... ugh.Do yourself a favor and AVOID Asus products.  It seems that if you have a problem with one, you're on your own.  Buying an Asus laptop has been the biggest purchase regret of my life.
-	I was excited about the touchscreen features etc. Couldn't even install office without the system memory (ram) becoming bogged down.. I returned it the same day, which I believe is a first. I hardly ever return anything. If you are on the fence spend a little more money and get something else. This computer would be fine for the Android or Chrome OS but not for Windows 8.1.
+	This laptop is the crem de la crem. The amazing speed, the style, the backlight keyboard are just a few of thebeautiful things about this work of art.
+	There's nothing I want to do that I can't with this laptop.All the games I want are or are to be released to its platform.OS is reliable, stable and easy to operate.Its construction is done perfectly.
-	You may find yourself in search of a new computing device. You may be enticed by the allure of unnecessary features, product claims, or the wolf in sheep's clothing that is affordability of HP products. But for the greater good, I believe it is my obligation to inform the public that HP is a confidence man-like manufacturer of over-priced, disposable laptops. If you're looking for a product that will fail within a year of the purchase or, in many cases, just after the one year manufacturer's warranty has expired, then look no further. HP offers a plethora of devices that will burn a hole in your wallet and destroy your faith big business. HP's bottom line is not customer satisfaction, but rather profit maximization while reducing product costs, sometimes at the expense of the consumer. You may be thinking "it won't happen to me" or "defects are rare", but after reading countless reviews, I have come to the conclusion that HP intentionally designs their products to fail just outside their warranty. So when your computing device does break, you find yourself in search of another, which HP hopes you'll come crawling back for round two. Or you may try your luck with HP's notoriously horrid customer service, which just so happens to be outsourced to locations where English competency is more like a peripheral thought. The blatant lack of concern for product quality, durability, and customer service on behalf of HP is a prime example of "buyer beware".
+	No complaints.  I bought this computer to help with video / photo editing.  I am a life long PC customer so it took some time to learn the operating system, but I have not looked back.  Battery life is fantastic.  I upgraded the RAM to 8GB and it flies!  Don't buy RAM from Apple.  Get it at BEST BUY.  I got it on sale for $25.
-	I bought this from Amazon as a gift for my brother for Christmas. I bought this few months earlier before Christmas because I had enough money, I didn't want to wait for Christmas because I might not have the money anymore.My brother only used it for 5 days just for regular surfing, then one day he turned it on, it would turn on but there was an error. The error was: cnx00000034  Insert the recovery media cd (which did not come with any installer or cd) or contact your manufacturer.I contacted Gateway,it was easy to contact their customer support through chat, I was told there might be wrong with the BIOS or hardware. We tried to troubleshoot the BIOS. It didn't work it went back to the screen with the same error. So he then told me it was the hardware. It cost me $120 to ship the laptop to another country. He wanted me to send the laptop back to them, which I can't do because it's not worth it sending the laptop back and forth. I told them I will just buy the hardware from them, then he told me that I need to send them the broken part before I can buy the hard drive. Why do I need to send the broken part when I'm not doing this as a part of warranty? He told me that's the only way for me to buy the hard drive from them, if I send them the broken part and it's not a guarantee that it will work. He said this issue is quite common. I am buying the part and paying for it not a warranty replacement!! The agent was nice and helpful except the quality of this product is very poor and also their policy on replacing parts is really horrible.I have always recommended Gateway to my friends and family. I will never recommend Gateway products again!I spent $500.00 on a laptop that was only used for 5 days!
+	Could be better.Tired of having to replace my cheap computers and spending all that money for something with poor performance.Over all the MacBook is put together well. The rubber seems stay in place, the power button is flush with unparalleled precision. Doesn't have a cheap feel to it.i5 processor can handle most jobs fairly well. Not powerful enough to play games or do any heavy-duty video processing, but mild video processing is acceptable. Only 2 usb ports which takes some getting used to and it's expensive to replace parts. For example the one I got was used of course so one of the ports doesn't work and the track pad sucks compared to using a mouse. A splitter might solve that problem for you.Also since this is high performance you might want to get a cooling pad to keep your lap from catching fire and some plugs to keep the dust and stuff out of the external ports and holes and such and forts and poles and lunch.
+	I bought this product from Amazon Warehouse deals. The shape said "very good". I had recently bought this model from apple online refurbished. The total was $1,010 with tax. The Amazon Warehouse deal was $882 with tax and overnight shipping. I was crossing my fingers that the shape would be good. I was amazed! It was shipped very well in the original box! No scratches, and plastic on the screen! I also called Apple and they said the warranty was effective until May, 2013. So this was a real $128 win, with only a little over 2 months lost in warranty. I love Amazon!
+	I purchased this model in 2012. Yes, you heard me right, 2012. Reason being is that the jump to Ivy Bridge and 1600 Mhz ram does't make that much noticeable difference in everyday usage, but the savings up-front do make sense. I went ahead and slapped 16 gb of memory in this bad boy (yes, it's possible), plus a hybrid HD/SSD and it so fast. I would highly recommend this product. I plan on rolling this for a few years, and I have full confidence that the laptop will deliver. I highly recommend this computer.
+	I upgraded from the regular white MacBook to this laptop back in March. I've had my old MacBook for about 3 years and did a lot of video, photo and other digital media on it. When I purchased this computer and saw that my rendering time for videos was being cut down by DAYS I couldnt believe that I ever edited on my old MacBook. The graphics and visuals are absolutely breathtaking, the light up keyboard is really nice, the overall craftsmanship of this computer is beautiful and such a step up from the regular macbook. I've had this computer for about half a year now and it looks like it did when i first took it out of the box without any maintenance whatsoever. After seeing what the MacBook Pro is capable of, I will never go back to any lower model or different brand. I recommend this computer for anyone and everyone, but especially those who work with HD video and other digital media. It is truly an amazingly fast, smooth, and beautiful machine.
+	Fast, quiet, stylish, good size, one of the few that offered WinPro 7. I would have given 5 stars if it had higher capacity battery
+	The purchase was excellent and very quick. The only thing I can say about it is that it supposed to come with Windows 8 but it's7... for all the other things it's ok. Thank u.
+	Set up, performance, and yes WiFi all work flawlessly - out of box without any driver updates.  I'm not sure why some are claiming major WiFi issues, but I have had none.  For the price, I don't think you can beat its performance.  I also downloaded Microsoft Office 2013 Professional and all is good.  Again, it to works flawlessly.  I have been a Dell and HP fan in the past but it seems their build quality has dropped for their lower end models while Acer is trying to grab some market share and it shows in the quality build of this model - again not sure why some are complaining here either - my daughter compared it to Apples $1600 laptop, in build quality.  I don't typically write many reviews but I'm so impressed with this purchase, and almost didn't buy it because of the somewhat negative reviews.  I just don't seem to have any of the problems others have claimed.  Good luck with your decision.
-	Laptop upon setup displayed the following error: HP SETUP NOT RESPONDING....  I have no time nor desire to deal with a DOA product from HP.
+	This is my second Mac purchase. I had sold my last Macbook (White polycarbonate) to go traveling and bought a Dell instead. It wasn't the brightest idea I've ever had. My Dell wasn't an entry level laptop it was actually the XPS M1330 with all the options. After upgrading to Win7 I thought my laptop was fast enough and the screen was bright and crisp. After breaking it I decided it was time to go back to a mac. I wasn't disappointed.This laptop can run laps around my Dell. Paired with a Seagate Momentus XT 500 GB 7200RPM SATA 3Gb/s 32 MB Cache 2.5 Inch Solid State Hybrid Drive ST95005620AS-Bare Drive This laptop is faster than most $2300+ Windows computers and outperforms any windows pc in terms of start up/standby/resume/shutdown speed. I find that the graphics switching helps keep the laptop cool and the fan quiet under normal web browsing and document drafting. 3D drawings load quickly and you rarely find any lag while working on large 3D projects.I only carry the charger everywhere with me because I never know when I'm going to be spending extra time in the library or spending all day away from home. However I rarely find that I need to plug in during a normal day of classes and some study time inside the library. In case you need to fuel up between meetings and whatnot the battery charges to 80% fairly quickly.Usability is greatly improved over Windows machines with the extra large trackpad that conveniently doesn't get in the way while you're typing on the full size keyboard that is a joy to type on. I find that with the keys the way they're designed has me typing ~10 WPM more than other less intuitively designed keyboards. The backlight in the keys also help when you're on a plane or other dark places like certain lecture halls. It does however eat up more juice than I'd like.If your anticipating on doing more Graphics design or 3D drawing I would suggest upgrading to the Apple MacBook Pro MC723LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop otherwise this will be more than plenty to satisfy the general user and student. However I do suggest the 8GB RAM Memory kit for all you multi-taskers out there.
+	Its an older laptop fraught with troubles yet I highly recommend a rebuilt refurbished model especially if it has windows 7 installed. It is very fast and maintenance free. I would recommend a cooling pad for it as with the original models, they had a heating problem.As for price, you cannot beat a rebuilt/refurbished model.I recommend it for those who need a back up, a very reliable workhorse.
-	I have always liked vaios and bought a viao z to replace my trusty old 10" screen vaio tr.It worked fine apart from the scratches on the lcd caused by the keyboard and after 10 months the unit failed. Fair enough they do that, my Toshiba quosmio has been repaired 3 times.Sony however is different, the only way you can contact them is by phone and on a long automated option that left me on hold for 40 minutes at a time.My case was complicated in that I bought my vaio while working in San francisco and moved back to the UK with it. Sony Europe would not honour a US garrantee and so I was forced to send it at my expense to San Diego repair centre.So far I was not really upset, I thought it would return quickly, and I should not have bought such a portable world wide item in the wrong market, obviously you are not meant to travel with it.This is when Sony became a faceless uncaring organisation. Who would have thought a high tech compoany was unable to email its customer, or track its own records?In the mean time my quosmio went off to have a hard drive replaced no problem and returned.Still no word from Sony, After lots of phonecalls through their intermnible auto system and the 40 minute hold times i was told it was about to be estimated.after still more calls and hold times I was told that there would be a 824 dollar bill for non guaranteed repairs.The fault i reported was a failed hard drive!I was promised email contact but none ever came and I still do not have my 2000 dollar laptop back.Stick to Toshiba they care
+	This product is amazing! I use it everyday and it works like a charm! i play some video games on it and I started to play my most demanding game that would crash my old computer and this one got 60 fps in it! GREAT MACHINE! i was going to buy a new mabook pro but I'm glad I did not, it cost twice as much and this preforms better!
-	Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY FROM HERE. I bought this Apple MacBook Air for my sweet wife, and it has broken 3 times already. First the logic board in the first week. A month later, a chip had gone corrupt.  Save your money, go to the apple store directly. Pay a few bucks more and get something from apple directly.  We had the option of returning it, but we decided to bring it to the apple store and try fixing it.  We just got our fixed mac book laptop from them again tonight, the chip has gone corrupt again.  What do the technicians say? Oh, always make sure to buy their apple care.  We've had the computer 2 months.
+	I bought this new Macbook Pro,  I'm so glad that I did. and in my opinion it deserve any penny I spent on it. Mac Book Pro all the way.
-	From the very minute we received these it has had nothing but problems. locks up constantly. has no volume what's so ever. try to play a movie and you can forget about it. our $300.00 compact out performs this thing what a joke for a $ 1,000.00 no thank you
+	I LOVE my New MacBook Pro. It is taking a little getting used to having come from the PC world. Its a whole new animal altogether. The thing is, I'm getting used to it very quickly, and falling in Love all over again. The way that the Mac is so user friendly and kinda shortcuts most everyday computer operations. Streamlining the whole personal computer process. Not only that, it RUUUNZZ!!! I mean it runs like an Olympic Champ. It is so smooth and so fast regarding all operations. I will NEVER own anything other than a Mac again if I can at all help it.
+	Wanted an Asus for my daughter to go to college, but had a very limited budget. This was a very nice one, I bought it because it said Windows 7, however the first owner installed Windows 8. My daughter said OK I will just try 8. She took about a day to get used to it and was happy, happy, happy! Well made, runs fast and got a good computer for a good price. She's happy so I guess no problems.
-	The laptop is great except for 1 important feature the size of the SSD hard drive. The claim is 128 GB and it is no where close. The bytes are 112,843,550,720 bytes or 105 GB.I have 2 other 128GB SSD drives and they each are 127,928,365,056 bytes which is 119GB.I understand how the manufacturers cheat by rounding bytes to GB. Sony you are no where close on this.It should really advertise as 112 GB or 105 GB.Completely false advertising.Also the wireless speeds are extremely slow. My other laptop and desktop are getting downloads of around 7 Mbps (both have Windows 8). This laptop is only getting around 1Mbps.Here is a link to the issue.[...]**Update I contacted Sony help desk. The recovery  partition is around 16 GB. After initializing a recovery Windows returns an error can not find recovery partition. So Sony is sending me the 6 DVD disc recovery.I have Windows 8 pro that I installed on a PC it all fits nicely on 4GB. I find it problematic to have only around 60% of the hard drive space available, when you first use it.
+	I did allot of research on resfurbished laptops because i never bought one before but with limited amount of funds it was a promising buy for me. I never wright reviews but i figured if you are like me this would be some help for you. It is just like buying a brand new computer and i will never go back to buying brand new again. This is above and beyond what i expected. works perfect. I use it for the internet,music,ipod,writing resumes and more. it is perfect you will not be disappointed you went this route. i bought cricket wireless prepaid which is cheap but works great. Trust me i do not work for these people i am just an average 24 year old and this is the best thing i ever did!!!! so happy and you will be too!!
-	When browsing the internet the screen zooms in and you have no control of viewing. Also the screen display shuts off or gets frozen when shifted into a different position.
+	Apple MacBook Pro MC723LL/A 15.4-Inch LaptopI have spent months reviewing different laptops. I've gone through at least 10 laptops in the last year looking for that one laptop that I will be pleased with and keep for more than a year or two. I've had Acer, HP, Compaq, Asus, Sony, Toshiba, and others. Sony was the only laptop that didn't go FUBAR within a year or so.So, I thought I would give Apple a shot and I was not disappointed. I first tried out a 17" dual core that was super but the resolution was just too small for my eyes and I returned it. But I was so impressed with the quality of the case, the screen (albeit the resolution too small for my eyes), the quality of the innards (no cheap stuff under this hood), the quality of the power cord, the very fast 800 firewire, the backlight keyboard, the ease of typing on the keyboard, and the mouse pad. The mouse pad on this laptop was the first one I have not had to disable while typing. I have no idea why we have been stuck with those stupid PC mouse pads for so long when the solution was so easy! On the Apple laptop you push the pad down instead of tapping it. This means the cursor does not move to some abstract place and you find yourself typing three pages back!But, then Intel released their new Sandy chips. I figured that Apple would not use these chips for some time so I started looking at PCs again just for the new chip. I couldn't bring myself to buy a PC after owning a Apple. Fortunately Apple did release these new Macbook Pros with Intel's new chip with increased graphic memory and the new Thunderbolt. Plus Apple increased the speed of the memory.I just could not help myself and I purchased this MBP 15" with the 2.2 i7 Sandy Bridge with the 1G memory. I am very glad I did. This laptop is fast. Its unibody case makes this the most solid and durable laptop on the market. The innards are easy to access to upgrade memory and the hard drive. Everything inside this machine is neatly arranged and is of top quality. The battery is rated for seven hours which is pretty accurate. The Mac OS is written to take advantage of the quad core chip, memory, etc. The LED screen is crisp and clear, and with the regular 1440X900 resolution I can easily use this laptop without any eyestrain.I only have one puzzling complaint about this new laptop. Why in the world would a company build one of the fastest top quality laptops in the world and stick a hard drive spinning at 5400 RPM? Yes it is a 750 gigabyte drive, which few people including myself could never fill. But running at 5400 RPM? I just cannot understand this.You can order the drive spinning at 7200 RPM or opt for a SSD on the Apple online store. The strange thing is that the 7200 RPM drive is the same price as the drive spinning at 5400 RPM. But that is not the point. Yes, most people will never notice the speed difference between a 5400 RPM and a 7200 RPM drive unless you are doing some pretty intensive media editing or are a avid game player. The point is why build a top of the line laptop and stick in a old busted down 5400 RPM hard drive like an afterthought. I fixed this discrepancy by installing a new Intel 160G SSD (solid state drive).I have been using laptops since 1991 when they made great paperweights when they died. This is the best laptop I have ever owned. Do yourself a favor and try one. Even if you don't like it you can always return it. I don't think you will, but you do have that option.
+	first Mac I've owned in years and wished it hadn't taken so long. Very happy with my choice. Macbooks are a great choice of laptop
+	From the moment you open the 'briefcase' style box, layered with a felt like material, you know you have a product of sheer quality, and this is certainly not a misconception.before i got my macbook, i was a committed Windows user, and now i couldn't begin to think of going back to Windows full time. everything about the mac book seems much more logical and intuitive.People are often put off by having to learn another operating system, however the mac is so cleverly designed that from the moment you turn it on you know what to do.. you can explore the computer yourself and the whole time small messages will pop up helping you along the way, and you will look back to how you learnt it and only remember it being simple.you can spent 600 pounds on a good PC and in about 4 years it will feel prehistoric and incredibly slow, the macbook does not have this problem, mine has never dipped in speed once and still impresses me on every use.If the laptop has one fault it is that it gets quite hot, probably due to the metal casing, but this is not a significant problem.I would recommend this to anyone, and if you look around you in this day and age, you can see an 'Apple revolution' is upon us, so maybe now is the time to switch.
+	Cannot believe it took me so long to make the switch to Apple. What was I thinking? Easy - user friendly - no hassles -
-	They would not honor the one year warrantee they said I purchased it in July and I bought it in September from Amazon and would only give me a 10 month warrantee.  They asked for a hand written receipt from Amazon when I said they do not give receipts that your debit card is your receipt.  They did not want to even accept that unless I faxed the entire bank statement to them.  I refused because there is too much confidential information on it and only copied and pasted the transaction into an email. 26 emails to them and sending the information over and over and even 3 times in one day to 3 different people.  They are useless in my opinion and do not deserve to receive my money for future purchases anymore.  Going to buy a MAC next!
+	After 5 different computers and only needing 1. A very nice Amazon rep. helped me in choosing a very nice and very fast computer. I would recommend this computer to anyone with the need for above average speed and the willingness to learn the Windows 8.1 o/s. I pay no attention to brand names on electronics' anymore. I am just happy with the stress free operation of this unit.
+	This is my first true Laptop. I previously used PCs, the last being a 16" sony Vaio. I decided to finally try Mac pro as all my friends were raving about it. I bought the 13" version, as I wanted a light laptop given that my previous one was too heavy to travel with or use outdoors. I also wasn't sure I would like Mac and so I got the cheapest version.I have to say that after a short learning period, I'm really satisfied with the Mac. I can say it's my first true laptop, it's really light and slim. Battery time is amazing about 5-6 hours. Love the touch pad and gestures. It connects better to the internet; faster connection to wifi and less crashes. Much faster connection to VPN networks.It takes time to get used to the finder instead of explorer (I personally prefer explorer were you can see folders easier and cut and paste files easier). Also I would have probably been able to get the top of the line PC with the same money for the cheapest Mac pro, some time it takes a longer for iphoto to work or microsoft office products to start working but once they start they are much more stable than on PC and the lag time is minimal and trivial to me.The 13" screen is adequate for internet browsing, watching videos/photos and writing documents. It is a little small for working on excel / databases. I might consider buying a 15" in the future if they become lighter.In summary, I'm glad I made the switch. Microsoft and PC manufacturers have to step up their game if they want to survive.
-	I used the Zenbook Prime for about a month before it began to fail to power on.  Pressing the power button over and over again would solve the issue for a while.  After about three months this laptop will not power on at all.  This laptop is made with parts from China.  I cannot praise the keyboard in this laptop.  It does not live up the image of quality presented by Asus.  Sadly, this laptop is junk that nobody should buy.  I am very sorry for buying this laptop and can not of good faith every buy Asus products again.Disassembly of this Zenbook Prime reveals the bad workmanship of these machines.  There are missing screws.  There is one loose screw at the corner of the keyboard at the location of power switch and the screws right next this one are missing.  When the power button is pressed the corner of the keyboard flexes and the laptop will not power up.  This laptop is one thousand dollars of garbage.The screw in the corner will not stay attached.  Moved a screw from other side of keyboard to hole next to corner by power switch.  Put some strong tape over the corner. Zenbook Prime is working again.  Asus should install a complete set of screws, Asus should not cut corners.  How many other things are hidden from our eyes?  Can Asus be trusted to built a quality machine?
+	If you're still on the fence about buying a Mac, this is the ideal place to jump off.  It is an exceptional entry point for the Mac experience ... great performance in a comfortable package.  Seamless aluminum case is functional, solid and very cool; display is better than most anything out there; and ... well ... it's a Mac.  Sure, the MacBook Pro may cost twice as much as entry point for PC laptop but that's kind of like comparing a tool to a toy - both appear to work but only one truly gets the job done (unless you happen to be 6 years old, in which case maybe you're okay with a disposable laptop).  The i5 processor is more than adequate for all but the most demanding jobs - my daughter uses this Mac for making videos for high school with acceptable performance.  I'm sure at some point we'll juice-up the memory but for now, it's just fine for routine tasks (surfing, word processing, e-mail and managing media library).  Only wish we had jumped onto the Mac side long ago and avoided years of frustration with PCs.
+	After doing graphic design work on PC's for over a decade I took the plunge to Mac.  Why the hell did I wait so long?!? I have only had my MacBook for about 40 hours, and had no previous Mac experience, and things are becoming pretty familiar already.  If you are concerned about switching operating systems, don't be.My last laptop was a Gateway and for the last year I have had an issue with the power supply.  I would spend as much time wiggling the damn power cord as I did actually working.  The Mac is well designed and shows a lot of attention to detail.  Form follows function so to speak.  So I really took notice while looking at something as small as the design of the magsafe adapter and power cord.  If Apple put that much thought into the cord (while most manufacturers treat that stuff as an after thought) then I have to believe that the really important aspects of the machine were in good hands as well.I also ordered a mini HDMI cable so I could plug into my flat screen TV.  So tonight I'm sitting in my recliner in the living room doing graphic design work on the big screen while running netflix on the laptop screen along with my email and about 4 other programs.  The MacBook didn't even break a sweat.Being a screen printer I was used to using CorelDraw for design work and was hesitant to switch to Mac since Corel isn't available in a Mac version.  No problems, I was able to set up a virtual windows machine using Parallels for Mac and can now run any windows program as well.  Sharing files between photoshop on Mac and Corel on windows was also very easy.This machine is a bad ass!Nothing wrong with pc's I will still be using one at work but if you are considering getting a Mac...Jump on in the water is fine.
-	this computer is so slow.the screen freezes every 10 days so when it freezes i have to take out the battery.this crap wastes all my time.when installing 1 simple program it takes at least 10-20 minutes for the program to be instaled.i had to fix this computer twice in the last month.another big problem is the overheating.the 1st day i got the computer it started heating up so rapidly i could not stop it.now i have to carry a portable fan where ever i go so it does not overheat.every time you have a 50 50 percent chance of having internet connection.it takes a long time to load a page on the web and it takes a long time load programs and send mail.im a macintosh kind of guy. i have no clue why i bought this pile of crap in the first place.i will never buy a toshiba again.id recomend buying a macintosh.well anyway have fun dealing with this box full of crap.
+	Okay, This was a great purchase for the price.  I researched all possible competing laptops and none came close.  After using this product for a month, I have concluded the following:Pros:1.  Speed of computer is superb2.  Starcraft 2 on ULTRA settings run flawlessly3.  Can run multiple games (Counterstrike, diablo 3, and starcraft with no lag simultaneously)Cons:1.  Hard drive could be faster 5400rpm.  If you have a a little extra money then just replace the hard drive with a SSD.2.  Screen sometimes looks a little grey. But thats during daylight.  At night its awesome.So concluding, I would definitely recommend this to any wanting a high end gaming laptop for a reasonable price.Also, at [...]  they have an older model backpack solid black, that is a ROG official backpack for 17.3 inch laptops for 49.99.  Pick that up right away as its a great sale.
+	I got this notebook several months ago and I've had a great experience with it. I've had zero problems with it, and I'm very pleased with Vista as well. The one thing I would change about it is that mine takes it's sweet time booting up when I turn it on. Once it's all ready to go, however, it runs very fast. I'm sure that's something I could help by changing some settings, but it's the only negative thing I have to say about this computer. I have The Sims 2 Deluxe on here, and am very pleased with how fast the game runs on this notebook. I've had absolutely no problems with the computer handling any software I've added.We got it for a great price! And if you just need a basic, good computer, this is a good one to go with. It would be especially good for a student.
-	On paper looks great. But if it won't type because the keyboard is defective, it is useless. The first one the keyboard didn't work from the start. Amazon was great with the exchange process. Second one worked for about five minutes before different keys stopped working.  Laptop was on a flat, stable surface (tabletop)It was not a typing issue where I was missing keys because of the slightly different layout. This was trying to hit one key repeatedly, as a test: "eeeeeee" and maybe getting one "e" to show up. Only it was multiple keys like this.So if you can't type on it, it's just a paperweight. I did not test using an external keyboard, I needed a laptop. I ended up with the Acer Aspire S7. Same incredible screen resolution, not quite as powerful, but everything works.
-	Never seen a laptop with a single bad pixel with LED display before. And MSI said it is common and can't be prevented. Even more they said they can fix it only if there are 7 or more bad pixel on the display. Which made perfect non sense to me. Although the other parts seems ok but still I don't like this attitude.BTW, their customer service system is BS. I have to pull out the battery to find the service # and the it's not real time service on the internet. Once you post your request you gonna wait till you get an email saying someone has replied you. And that's it. They will ask a lot of dumb questions as if I'm a stupid fool that I can't tell if its hardware issue or software problem.So as a conclusion, if you get a good one then I believe it is pretty awesome. But if you get a bad one like I do, it's BS.
+	If you are in the market for a 15" MacBook Pro this is the one you want, If you are not a tech person, and you are looking to buy a MacBook Pro 15", read this review, It will save you a lot of researchAs of right now this model is on sale almost everywhere, because they are the high end model from early 2011, and are now clearance items. The current high-end 15" model retails for 2199, where-as you can get one of these for 1799$.The newest high-end model has only one "improvement", which is a 2.4 ghz processor, a minuscule .2ghz increase from the previous 2.2ghz.Reason #1.The "Newest Model" MacBook 15.4" 2.2ghz(late 2011) priced around 1700$ is a base model, this may look the one to buy, because it is newer. This is not the case, the Early 2011 (Old Version) is a high end model, this models processer is the same speed as the "Newest Version" but it is not the same processer, the "Old Version's" processer has a significantly better turbo boost.Reason #2The "Newest Version" has the 6970m graphics card w/ 512mb Vram, where as the "Old Version" has the same graphics card but with 1024mb(1gb) which is literally doubled!Whatever you do, Do not buy the MacBook Pro 15.4 2.0 ghz (Early 2011)"Old Version", it has a 256mb graphics card which IMHO is a rip-off.
-	Important to note that Samsung has the worst warranty process I've ever experienced, and as a result, I'll never purchase their laptops again. I've had Toshibas, Dells, IBMs, etc. I'm a high-end power user (Photoshop, Dreamweaver, etc.) and I'm also extremely tech-savvy when it comes to fixing electronics. I purchased this laptop and the drive crashed after 2 months. I had to send the laptop to their Texas facility (it took 3 weeks for the turnaround)... 2 months later, the system crashed a second time. In a 1 year period, this laptop has crashed a total of 4 separate drives. Each time, reloading my system with all my software takes a good 4hrs.  Imagine, each time you lose your laptop for 3 weeks. Their "executive customer relations" department is without a doubt, the worst, rudest, and most arrogant department I've ever had the misfortune to deal with. Samsung's entry into the laptop market really leaves a lot to be desired. This has been a nightmare experience from beginning to end.  They don't give a damn about the customer.When they finally offered a "same as or better" replacement, they considered that offering me a 15.6" laptop screen instead of the 17.3" I currently had was the "same or better". Also, their "refund" was not for my full purchase price - it was for $200 less after a year of continual crashes.  I finally gave up with them, filed a claim with Amex platinum and they refunded me the entire price - let them deal with this garbage. My time is worth much more than spending in excess of 10hrs dealing with Samsung...Incidentally, after the 1TB drive failed that arrived with the system, I purchased a solid state drive.  It then crashed that drive.  Luckily that drive (by Crucial) was under its own warranty and they have had to continually replace it for me 3 times.  At this point, they won't replace it for me any more as it's obvious the fault is with the laptop. So, I'm out the price of the solid state drive ($350).  Samsung, even though they accept responsibility that the laptop caused the failures will give me no reimbursement at all.It really is the absolute worst customer service.  It is not only the laptop that stops me from buying from them again, it's the support - if something goes wrong, you really are in trouble.
-	The internet did not work I was on the phone with Dell for about 5 hours installing stuff. Finally they sent a person to my house to try and fix it but he didn't so then after 10 weeks I got them to send me a new computer.
+	I have upgraded the RAM to 8GB (maxed out), replaced hard drive with 256GB SSD right after I received this from amazon.  Added boot camp with windows 8 OS and that boots up fast as well.Screen is bright and clear.  Sometimes the fan make noise when I play games or running video/photo editor which is normal as the video card heats up when using heavy graphics program.Keyboard is soft and very comfortable.  Trackpad is very useful as there's an ability to zoom in/out.
+	I have been an Apple laptop owner for the last 6 years now. The MacBook Pro line is, of course, at the top of Apple products. The setup of this machine was smooth. I was able to transfer all of the data and applications from my previous MacBook Pro to this new gadget without any issues at all. It is faster. It has more memory. I vote for the upgrade. Do it!
+	It is a graduation gift so I just looked at the features which were pleasing  to me.  Chose this over many others.
+	The 15" MacBook Pro I recently purchased is awesome!  I've always been a Mac user, but I was plesantly surprised when I opened the box.  It has so many features and very user friendly.  I would highly recommend this computer and really glad I decided to get it; another great Steve Jobs product!
+	This laptop is very beautiful and very great, but I upgraded the memory so it would be faster. Now running with 8GB of Ram, I would never switch to another computer. It is so fast that it just blows any windows computer I've used out of the water. This laptop is clean and stays clean, although it gets scratched pretty easily so I might get an invisible shield on it.Zagg invisibleSHIELD for MacBook 13-Inch Unibody Full Body (APPMB2FB)
+	Alright.. I read most reviews before buying. Most of the negative reviews don't make sense.  I'm not sure why the people that wrote them feel so angry about Apple stuff. Maybe they did get lemons. Not sure. I'm very computer savy. Been using selling and enjoying computers since late 80's. I used to sell them at Price Club, now Costco, when the max proccessor speed was 4.77MHz and and two 5.25 inch floppys...360k. 8088 computerThen came 286, then 386, then 386sx, dx, 486 and so on....My first laptop....386 with 20mb hardrive and monochrome screen....Owned & operated a bulletin board out of Anchorage prior to Gore "inventing" the internetI know most have clicked past this uninteresting review..but listenThis is an amazing machine...Some say Apple is over priced. Please consider anything that compares to a pc lap/note computer that has the build quality of the unibody MBP.Won't find anyI love my Dell Studio 8000 desktop  at my house. Very powerfull and can do anthing I throw at it, but I also like Mac.Lion 10.7 was defiantly different than what I was used to with windows 7. But not that much different.I really like Safari and am know using it instead of IE on my desktop.I am computer literate. Mac or PC...doesn't matter. I just really appreciate both and am very thankfull and impressed with the current technology.I added 512gb ssd drive and 16gb ram.  Overkill..ya probably.Conclusion.....MacBook is a work of art...so durable and so attractive..very solid build......
-	I highly recommend you do NOT, I repeat DO NOT buy this laptop. If you look around at forums and such, you will find many issues with it being a low quality laptop. Ahead are just a few examples of customers complaining about freezing problems and crashing problems. Other customers complain about blue screens and mouse pad freezes. I have one myself, and I am extremely frustrated as this is my only computer to work with. Every minute or so, the computer will freeze for about 30 seconds and then come back. I have tried many things to fix it, all of them you may find in the following forum posts, but none have worked. Do NOT buy.Any hope for a g62-340us fix?

-	I received my computer today and I found out that the computer is very slow.  I called HP service and asked her to help me to remove the unneeded programs from the startup, HP service would like me to pay for this.  Then I asked whether HP has a web page so that I can follow the directions to uninstall the programs from the startup, so that my computer can be faster.  There is no such a help page.  It is a bad experience for me so far.
-	I bought this beginning of last month. It felt amazing to open the box and see it packaged in multiple boxes, box art was nice and attractive, by the time i removed the laptop from the packaging I was anxious to powerr up the laptop. When i hooked up the cables to power computer, it would not turn on. I figured it was probably my fault for not letting it charge for an hour or so. So I left it charging, it still wouldnt turn on, 15 minutes later it turned on, but it kept shutting down. At this point I figured that maybe the battery needed to charge more, left it alone for 30 minutes and it finally turned on.I frequently had problems wwith the computer attempting to turn on and in the end after contacting customer service through MSI they gave me instructions on how to pinpoint the problem. It ended up being a defective power button, it was broken or wrongfully manufactured.The seller of this laptop tends to respond slowly to most of my questions. If anything they responded to me only after I filed an A to Z claim through Amazon. I'm just so disappointed at this point. I started off by sending calm letters and they drove me to the point of disappointingly writing a bad review on here. I say you are better off buying from a retailer so you wont deal with the stuff I had to deal with. Replacements take over a week, and refunds even longer.
+	I had reservations about buying a used laptop online, but I needed something in a hurry that wouldn't break the bank. What I got was an amazing laptop that works wonderfully. The only negative thing was the power cord had a tear in it and was not usable, but I had an extra one so I can use my laptop as much as I want. I use it primarily for school and it has never let me down.I will definitely but from this seller again
+	got this for christmas  a little of getting a learning curve  . been a pc  guy  for about  20 + years  this  is easier  so far so good!!!! update !!!!use it everyday no hang ups no error messages always on sleep mode  it's great!!!!!!
+	I went through 4 laptops before I finally got what I wanted.  This is exactly it.  It's lightweight, sleek, and durable.  The sound is better than any of the 4 previous brands I tried.  I use it for school and entertainment and it's great so far.
-	This was NOT definitely the computer that I was specting, it is very old, the processor is just a intel core 2 duo, it has at least like 3 and half years and the condition is very damage, even has huge strike!
-	My review is based on the customer service I have received from ASUS. Within 2 hours of owning this laptop, the screen went fuzzy and the only way to clear it out was to force a shutdown on the system. I contacted ASUS through there customer sight and they returned an email guiding me through several things to try. It was obvious the email was not written by someone that has a grasp of the English language. It was almost like reading one of those emails you get from someone trying to scam you into opening an account that they will deposit money into. Anyway, after trying all the suggestions, I still have the same problem. They send me another email telling me to download a new update to the video card which had to be done through a third party web sight which didn't seem to be very secure. After downloading the update, My laptop gave me the message that it was not compatible with the video card I have. I answered there customer survey wanting to know what I thought about their customer service. I asked them to send me a disc with any updates I need. I also asked them to call me or email me but to make sure the person that contacted me was fluent in English. I never heard from them. I sent in another request for service and did all the things they told me to but still have the same problem. I am now waiting on an RMS (whatever that is) I sent in this request on 8/29/2012 and have yet to get a reply. I really like the laptop when it works. It is fast and does just what I need it to do, but I would not buy another ASUS based on the customer service. I have googled this problem and it seems this is a very common problem for ASUS. If you would like to see what mine is doing, you can go to a facebook page I have set up with a video of what it is doing. It happens about every other day now.[...]I have purchased several items from Amazon and I am very happy with them. This is just my experience with ASUS.
+	beautiful and amazing functionality right out of the box, but with RAM and SSD upgrade it's simply perfect!! you wont be needing another computer in 2 or 3 years easily!!
-	The price is great but you get Garbage.  Within 1 week of buying I see that the keys on the keyboard stops working.  You will hit a J and it thinks you are trying to do F2 or screen swap.  The only way to get out of this is to log off and log back in.  The hot keys at the top of the keyboard are swapped.  So F5 does not do refresh.  I have never been able to successfully connect wirelessly with my printer.  Now after about 2 years, entire folders disappear.  What do I mean by that?  Well you can go to Windows Explorer (file manager) and you can go to your My documents folders and you can see your "Kids" folder (as an example) but if you write a word document and then go to save it, the "kids" folder within your My documents folder cannot be seen.  So what I have to do is save it to my desktop and then move it manually to the kids folder.  This also means that for the most part if I want to send an email with an attachment I need to save to the file to my desktop to ensure I will be able to find the file to attach to the email for sending.  I bought this laptop brand new and before this I had a Compaq Presario CQ60 that went bad a few short years after buying brand new.  I am really starting to think I should avoid all HP laptops all together.
-	This is my saga of attempting to use Dell's extended warranty.My saga begins in January of this year.  My Dell Inspiron Notebook began to fail.  This resulted in four technicians visiting my home.  I waited for one technician on three different days until he finally showed several hours late on the fourth appointment.  The first replaced my video card, the second replaced my video card but when this did not work, he phoned and another technician came and replaced the LCD.  The third replaced the video card, the LCD, and the motherboard.  There was still a problem.  I might add that with three of these, there was a long conversation on the phone.  I am now quite good at understanding Indians speaking broken English.When my computer failed again Dell finally agreed to replace my computer.  While very frustrated, I felt at least I was making progress even though this meant I would have to reload all my programs.  My refurbished computer arrived and it was an upgrade over my old computer.  I reloaded my programs but quickly noticed a problem with the hard drive hanging up.  I could not believe Dell would send me a computer with a bad hard drive but after talking to Dell again and running a long test, the hard drive was indeed found to be bad.Dell then told me they would send a new preconfigured hard drive and it would arrive in ten working days.  I phoned again in fifteen days and they apologized that there was a technical problem and the hard drive had not been mail.  They guaranteed I would receive it in five days.  I phoned again the next day and the person could find no action had been taken but he agreed he would send the drive and it would arrive in three days but it would not be a preconfigured drive.  I would have to use the restoration disc.I phone again and they said I would receive it in two days.To be continued.
-	SCREEN CRACK IS A KNOWN ISSUE ONLINE BUT WHEN YOU CALL LENOVO SUPPORT THEY GIVE YOU THE RUN AROUND OF YOUR LIFE...PLAINLY SAYING DEFECTIVE PRODUCT NOT COVERED BY LENOVO..RUN AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.WILL PROVIDE UPDATE ON THE CASE..HAD TO FIGHT WITH THEM OVER THE PHONE FOR HALF AN HOUR FOR THEM EVEN LOG IT AS A CASE..GO FIGURE!!!
+	This is an addition to my other mac that include another 13 MBP. This one is just as amazing. Fast responsive, sleek what can I say just one of the best machines out there.
+	It's so easy to use, i just changed from pc, and its really friendly.Graphics and performance are great. I got the 2.8 ghtz, it works perfect.
-	What can I say, owned many HP laptops and they all start having major problems after the 1 year warranty mark.  When I call for customer support, they tell me it'll cost $400 to change a fan.  At least have repairs reasonably price... I would really like to see American based companies doing well but I think they have too many tricks up their sleeves.  My dad has a cheap Toshiba, it has been running long and strong since 2006.  My laptop just barely hit 1 year old and now the battery wont charge and the laptop overheats and shuts down.  No more of my family members will be getting HP computers, all three have been disapointing.
+	This was the BEST bang for my buck!!!!! Negative was no webcam or cd drive. However Now a days everything is on external drives anyway and webcams I use very rarely. Although I did buy an external dvd drive and webcam. I ABSOLUTELY love this better than any laptop or netbook I have had in the past. The service was EXCELLENT. I wasbeing deployed and the seller worked with me to intercept the package and ship another one next day. I had to pay the shipping but was a big surprise he helped out so much given the circumstances. If you have the money and looking for a COOL, FUN, HIGH SPEED,  AFFORDABLE, and TOUGH netbook and have the money BUY IT!!! You will NOT regret it. I can not say enough about this toughbook or the seller who helped out so much during a very difficult transaction.
+	Not only does this seem to work well ( how would I know since I gave it to my daughter and she never lets anyone else near it) but it also bought me much adoration from my college age daughter.  She says it's "awesome."
-	It's uncompleted operation system - Win8 installed. Because I cannot use remote desk to get access to the laptop, which means I have to bring it everywhere! It sucks. And I don't find any statement of the incomplete system on the sales page. It is one kind of swindle. Anyhow, I won't buy any products of HP, and I will advice my friend to seriously consider before they purchase HP.
-	I got this computer from birthday. I downloaded all my important files to this new computer. And donated my old computer to goodwill.Now the computer can not start. HP service center will reformate my computer. All my files will lose. Even with losing my all files, HP sevice center told me I have waited several day to fix it. I won't buy HP computer any more.
+	The new Early 2011 MacBook Pro 15" is an incredible leap in performance. I deal with new Macs every day, and most of the time a performance increase is not that great. This new line is a HUGE leap in performance, both in processor (quad core vs dual core) as well as graphics (discreet). I bought the low end 2 GHZ model and increased the RAM to 8G. I give VMWare 2 processors and 4G of RAM...Windows screams!!! For Adobe CS5 work, much, much faster than dual core.Don Montalvo, TX
-	Mac has set a pretty highbench mark for themselves with their "I'm a Mac, You're a PC" advertising".  Their laptop products, however, do not deliver on that promise.  I use both Mac and PC at work so I am familiar with the OS.  However, it definitely is not worth 3 times the price of comparable PC laptob to buy a MacBook Pro.  Plus you are also likely to find a lot of incompatibly issues.  In my case my MIDI devices no longer work for music studio functions and my video cameras are not supported by the new IO ports on MacBook pro.  It has really been nothing but frustration and nothing like the promise.  Wish I had just bought a PC laptop.  Would have cost me a third of the price.  I would likely have experienced some of the same frustrations, but at least I wouldn't have been deceived into expecting an easy ride.  And the work arounds likely wouldn't have been proprietary from Mac only $35 cables.  Don't believe the hype and don't pay the premium for Apple BS.
+	I love this laptop just as much if not more than my iPhone and they both work together perfectly...and there's so much to play around with like the apps and games ect.
-	Was excited to unpack this unit. Boot up was quick, but immediately noted difficulty with wi-fi receiver dropping signal from the wireless router. This happen both close-up and away from the router, both places where other wi-fi equipped units we own have no difficulty at all.  I think Asus got a bad batch of wi-fi antenna/receiver chips. My was a reconditioned unit.  Want to bet that it was returned due to the wi-fi problems?  So...I'm sending it back for credit.  I'll give the ACER S5 a shot next, hoping to have better luck the next go around.
+	my pro shipped fast and was delivered the next day! i paid for two day shipping and it came in one! i love all apple products and this was no exception. Easy set up, user friendly, and beautiful to look at! This is my first Macbook and i know i will never go back to PC. even my PC loving boyfriend was jealous!
-	This computer looks and sounds terrific on paper, but in practice it is has really been a big disappointment.The build quality is not what you would expect on a +1000 dollar laptop.  Furthermore if something goes wrong their customer support is worse than any other I have ever encountered and that's really saying something considering the low bar that is generally set for electronics RMA/product support people.Bottom line is you should steer clear of this product unless you aspire to be emailing back and forth with some guy in China who is speaking in broken English about giving you an RMA number and sending your unit in for repairs.
+	My second MBP and like my 5th mac.... beasting as usual... This is the best laptop I've ever owned. Insanely fast.. can encode an HD screenccast in like 2 minutes and have it on youtube. 40 apps open... np... Cant wait til ram comes down a little and I can upgrade to 16gb.. need to get an SSD and it will really fly. Sandy Bridge FTW :D It's the perfect laptop. Period. No complaints, only exclamation!
+	Like a Timex Watch this laptop has taken a beating, but keeps on ticking. It will hopefully perform for what it will be used for.
-	Don't even think about buying this laptop. My largest complaint is that the wireless connection device in it is horrible and cannot establish a decent connection for more than 10 minutes; you have to stop whatever you are doing to fix it every time it is disabled. This is not a router problem. All the other wireless devices in my home connect just fine. Another problem is that the keyboard is horrible. I am a fast typist (around 90+wpm) and I have had to stop to correct the letters that were not registered at least 15 times thus far in this paragraph. I am an English student, so I have to type a lot of notes and papers for classes.  I got this laptop on sale at Best Buy for around $550, but this is something I would have payed about $200 for. DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP; IT ISN'T WORTH IT.
-	I have to return it. it freezes up all the time. when you shut it off it doesn't want to turn back on.
+	This is a great little machine (and back up for my 21" iMac).  The screen is really an amazing thing to see, and the trackpad convinced me to buy the stand-alone track pad for my iMac.  The backlit keyboard is something all machines should have!I'm very pleased with this purchase, and glad I made it on Cyber Monday, when the price was lower.
+	I LOVE this MacBook Pro !, after having nothing prior but PC's this was a big step to take. I figured that since I already own an iPhone4 and several iPods my learning curve wasn't going to be insurmountable.Since this purchase I haven't touched or missed my old PC with Microsoft's CONSTANT and annoying security updates.I'll NEVER go back to a PC, in fact I'm currently trying to decide which iMac that I want for a desktop
-	This is bad. Troll i actually didn't buy it I just put a terrible rating for fun teehee tehee teehee trolled
-	This computer stopped working after the second time being turned off, it would not turn back on again.  Customer service was so-so, little help and I had to fight to get a return authorization.  They wanted me to back up my data on the computer, yet I could not turn it back on, and could not seem to grasp the idea I could not access the data.  And since the box was opened, I can not get my money back and am stuck with a non functioning computer.  Would not get this brand again.
-	Bad service! I returned the laptop after 1 day "using" as it even could't turn on (the battery was fully charged). Also I cant contact with the seller as I still haven't received response! I still waiting on my money back to my account (near 2 weeks)Natalia
-	I have not yet been able to use my HP Envy 17-3270NR because it was delivered with a crashed hard disk. So I am very disappointed that I had to install a new hard disk on the laptop.
+	The Macbook pro arrived before the expected day which is very good. I was very pleased because the computer was sent the day after the purchase.
+	i don't own this laptop i have a Toshiba 17.3" but i'm here to tell all you that hate windows 8 to go to [...] download it and all your problems are salved i did and love it,it makes things back to normal.you have your choice of  win xp to win 7 i think win 98 to. start button the hole works when you restart it loads the windows you chose not windows 8 and it's FREE.spread the word and start enjoying your pc and laptops again.hope this helped you guys.
-	Loved this laptop for the first six months. The hinges worked great and the cross-functionality between tablet and laptop was fantastic. However, after about six months of use I began to notice that the power cord and DC power jack were poorly constructed. The prongs in the jack stick out and completely broke off from the laptop during regular use. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed.I suppose this defect would not be a problem for those people who like to leave their laptop parked on their desk or table. However, this will pose a serious problem for anyone who carries their laptop with them while traveling. In these instances, the cord and jack will quickly give out.
+	Great as I expected. The battery life and desktop resolution is amazing. I used to be Windows user, I still miss some features, but Mac is way better I'm telling you. Once Apple, always Apple.
+	For years, literally years, my brother has been singing the praises of Mac computers. Six months ago I finally gave in and purchased this 13" model. What a great choice. the 13" is very comfortable to use and the build quality and fit and finish are second to none.About the only downside/complaint is that the screen resolution is a bit on the small size. It's not a great choice if you want to use this for a lot of Photoshop work, but it is large enough to handle the most common computer tasks.I've been using Windows since version 1.0 so I was a bit concerned that I could not do all the wiz-bang things that I was used to doing on a Windows computer. It took a little bit of time, but I so much more enjoy using the Mac OS X Lion than Windows. It slowly grows on you and in the first month or two you learn something new each day. One of the things I didn't expect is that I never use -- or feel the need to use -- a mouse. The multi-touch trackpad is so easy and feature packed that a mouse would be a big step backward.My recommendations to long-time Windows users is to make the switch. I purchased a copy of VMWare Fusion 4 which is a fantastic product that allows you to run "real Windows" on your Mac. The initial price of a MacBook Pro is higher than a Windows computer but you make this up in quality and the Mac offers a better total cost of ownership. If you want a trouble-free computer that is easy to use and just plain "works" buy a MacBook Pro.
+	Have had this Macbook for over a year now and I adore it. It still works perfectly and I haven't had any problems with it (the same cannot be said for my previous Windows laptop, I fought with that thing from the very beginning). I know people complain about Apple and they can be a pain at times, but I seriously adore this Mac. I won't be going back to Windows, at least not in my personal life. I have to use Windows for work.
+	have owned a good number of macs (mostly powerbooks and MacBooks), and this is my absolute favorite.(i DID replace the HD with an SSD, and put in 8gigs of ram...thank you amazon & black friday!).great size, weight. fast (the SSD is well worth it). great aesthetic. good screen (could be better...).very-good battery life.overall, am very happy. with the customizations, this mac is literally twice as fast as my late-2008 macbook(4gigs ram, default 5400rpm drive). seriously...i tested the speeds with geekbench.

Due to the Full Cost.\HP sent me a dead designed notebook computer called DV7-1000z same the usbal dead design issues. all of there notebooks comes with the worlds worst O.S. on the market. Windows Vista.Micorosft main O.S. to kill poeples computers. well to tell the real data. HP dose not need to do this evel work for them. HP dose it for the all mighty constituion rights.Microosft dose take heavy amout of the blame for this issue. However HP started it from the start. Still the DV7-1000z also main objective is the Windows Vista and the hardsware simply makes a dead computer run dead. well cannot access the internet. Unable to install sofrware and runn it beucase I did not order the software from HP. So they blacked it. the information was gaven to me from the corp level of HP. over a arument on the phone.Hewlett Packard dose argue and fignt over the phone. Not a way to treat the tax paying consumers. when I pay for something. I want it to work. Not design to spy on my Visa card, bank ccount,Persional ID, who I work for. who I am shopping with. Not of there busiess to do so. never the less due to the due to the freedom of rights. HP can do what ever they please.and the Federal Goverment of the United States of America dose use Hp servies to spy on who ever the Federal govement wants to do.did you follow the special report from CNBC reguarding big corperation ripping off peoples ID? Hewlett packard was on this report on there Lazer Printers. printing out a code in yellow dots on the paper. it canss what the document is. then Hewlett Packard gets all the documents and sells it to big corperation. The bigest customer I think is the US Federal Govermentto help out in some of there privet objective. want to keep a eye on some one.Hewlett packard phone support realy stinks. Hewlett pckard killed my account. Buecase I did not follow there rules and regulations. Ok Fine. building black market computers. selling in on the market. ripping off consumers and the consumers do not have the right to ask quetions on the subject? Hell I paid for it. I demand the service I need. if not. Hewlett packard dose not follow instutctions from the consumers. I am one consumer. when I told them them not do build dead computers for a living. build more and more and more. One other thing.when I tell Hewlett Packard to give me back the money.. there excuse is its too old. why its too old? HP dose not do anything. Waste my time and money. to enforce the all sales are final.I had persioal taken the mater to the US Goverment Atterney General office. I filed many suck reports on many charges I am placing agisnt Hewlett Packard. so far I have to hire my own atterney. Gee wis Hewlett Packaerd paid money to the Federal Goverment in order to have black market protection from the Federl Govmerment. the mail I have everty thime I file a report ends up with hire my own atterney. never send a federal agient to shut Heewlett packard down. Never both to ask me to look my my notebook computers and see for them selfs The Federal Goverment must learn about why I am doing my reports. lazy work form Federal goverment atterneys. come on. I got email from the US goverment not to keep filing new reports on Hewlett packard. I got snail mail demanding me to do the same thing. Not to file reports. Go to my privet atterney.Hewlett packard prodcution line is bad for the envirement. using not save production in China. in the USA its not allowed to use those hazard products however in China there is no law o hazard products.I do not recomand Hewlett packard to any consumers. If you want my dead computers to prove it. if any one wants one can buy my dead computers 1,200.00 each Full cost.if you want soemthing to use in court. some one with money wants to take down Hewlett packard can easy send me a message.I will be more then happy to support any one that is willing to take down Hewlwett packard. Note I do not have the money to dotate to a product like that. however I will be more then willing to sell my dead computers to any one is willing to take on Hewlett packard.
+	Everything is great about it except for the touch function. I could do without it.One or two keyboard keys get stuck from time to time.
-	I got my first laptop, and after I set it up, I noticed that when you dim the screen it flickers. After trying every solution posted on the net, I removed the hard drive, installed my old hard drive  with linux ( disabled secure boot) and the laptop had the same issue on linux. I got an exchange, and my second one had the same problem, a bit less obvious but still I expect a 100% perfectly working laptop, so I decided not to try a third time. I think if the refresh rate was 75Hz it might have been resolved, but I didn't wait a laptop to fix it myself.I just got my refund and will probably give MSI a visit.
+	stylish, fast and quick shipment. I love the keyboard and the fast processing speed for the OS. Nice job, lenovo. Glad to have you as a gift for my s/o.
-	I bought this laptop for the 17inch screen. I am a photography student so therefore, I need a big screen to edit pictures on that is portable. I bought this laptop from Wal-Mart for around $800 after tax. I also bought a 2 year warranty along with it. This laptop was great for the first few months that I had it. Had no problems with it and than while I was at school, it crashed on me and I had to reset it to it's original settings. I lost pictures that I couldn't replace, assignments for school, notes, my photo editing software, everything. So I had to restore it, I put my photo editing program back on it. Another month passes and it tries to crash again. Luckly, my Brother got it back up and running without it deleting everything. Now, just a few days ago, I got a windows pop up that said I needed to replace or send it into the factory for repairs to the Hard Disk. Also, the card reader went out on it recently too. I have to use a USB driven card reader to upload my pictures to the computer now. I've not even had it a year and it's already falling apart on me. So a summary of all that's went wrong.-It's crashed on my once and I lost everything.-Crashed on me a second time, but I didn't lose everything, but I have to boot it up in safe mode all the time now.-Now the hard disk is screwed up and it's telling me I need to replace it or send it in for repairs.-Card reader went out on it recently.I've never had a computer that's the much of a piece of junk. Also, other things that I do not like about it. This thing attracts finger prints VERY easy. The plastic up around the speakers seems to be hollow and very thin sounding when you tap it. Very cheap construction. The keyboard is cheap and moves when you push it down in certain spots. Just a very cheap made computer. If I was able to take my purchase back, I would and would have spent the $800 on a better brand. I didn't think I would be laptop shopping less than a year after I just got a laptop. But as I say again, DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP!
+	Fujitsu is not as well known as other Japanese manufacturers, such as Sony or Toshiba, but Fujitsu makes absolutely great notebook computers, and when you compare features to prices, you cannot beat Fujitsu for value.  The Lifebook LH532 i5 has more and better features that the Sony Vaio, which costs $250-300 more. The quality is excellent and the 24/7 service is great.Fujitsu Lifebook LH532 i5-3210 Notebook
+	Very happy with this product, for the money is the best you can buy.  Ubuntu is very user friendly.  Some things you may have to research a little bit, but that's fine is part of the fun about Ubuntu.  It runs videos well, may be a little slow at times but that's just fine.  I definitely recommend this product and if you need to know about Ubuntu just buy the book Ubuntu made easy.
+	I got this computer to replace my PC and I'm glad I chose this particular one.This notebook comes with Windows Vista Home Premium.  I wasn't too sure about having Vista, but after using it I do like it.  I use this notebook at home and the PC I use at work has XP.  I like Vista better than XP.  The biggest problem I had with Vista is that I could no longer use my very old inkjet printer.  I checked the printer manufacturer's website for a Vista driver and it was not providing a driver for that printer.  I can print from Vista with my somewhat newer laser printer.  I would suggest that before buying any computer with Vista, it would be wise to be sure your printer will run with Vista.The speed of this notebook is excellent.  My husband decided to double the RAM and it is now beyond excellent.This computer is great.  I need to explore more of it to find out everything it can do, but it has more than met my needs so far.  I would highly recommend this computer.In response to another review, I have not had ANY of the problems mentioned.  In fact, when we replaced computers at work a few months ago, I insisted on a Toshiba notebook for me (however it wasn't this particular model).  I do not hesitate to recommend Toshiba.
-	If you want to take yourself back to the era of dial-up modems, by all means purchase this computer.  It's slow that molasses in December.  Though, I loved the size and look of it, I couldn't bear the horrible slowness involved with every task this computer performed.  The track pad was less than responsive.  Thank god Amazon's return process is so simple.  I gave this computer 48 hours before I clicked the return button.  DONT DO IT!
+	My boyfriend loves this computer! I got it for his birthday and he was ecstatic! First off, it handles like a beast, and secondly, it looks like the designers were going for a Darth Vader meets Batman look. Badass computer, for sure!
-	As an owner of 3 IBM Thinkpads in the past I have been very disappointed with the Lenovo Thinkpad T61p. It worked well enough for nine months but then the screen went out. When I returned it to Lenovo for warranty repair they said the screen was not covered and demanded $700.00. I pointed out that the machine had not suffered physical damage(not dropped or dented) but they said that "sometimes this just happens" and it is not covered under the warranty. Some warranty! Lenovo is not in the same class as IBM. I suggest you look elsewhere for a reliable machine and a reputable manufacturer that honors it warranty.
-	I am forced to use this computer for work. For my personal laptop, I have a Thinkpad T520 (15.6" screen). I think you can tell how this review is going to go...In short, I loathe this computer. A significant part of my animosity stems from two things: 1) lots of other employees received thinkpads; 2) HP elitebooks receive universally good reviews. Enough to make me think something fishy is going on...(or these corporate drones really are more gullible than people give them credit) And so, dear readers, it is up to Mavericks(TM) such as myself to reveal the truth---these so-called "ultra portable" business notebooks suck.Apparently, HP's idea of "ultra portability" means shrinking down the screen and the keyboard until it's practically unusable (missing keys!), while maintaining bulk. This thing is bloody thick for such a tiny computer. Some versions---mine included, I discovered to my unending dismay---don't even have an optical drive. I think it has 2 USB drives, located (unergonomically!) in the back, right next to where the giant battery juts awkwardly out.Furthermore, you'd think the promise of "ultra portability" would include silence. Wrong. This laptop is loud, whirring and groaning in protest if I dare to run more than 3 applications simultaneously. I mean, what do you expect corporate drones to do with a business laptop? Surf the internet in a text-based browser??And the one thing that's really bothered me: how much other reviewers heap praise on this piece of crap for being "fast," having great specs! But if you look at the specs, you'll see that they're merely decent. Nothing to write home about. Until you look at the accompanying price, and then the absurdity hits you! WTF, how do these people get away with charging so much money for this tiny mediocre piece of hardware?? I mean, have we descended to the abysmal ranks of Apple fanbois??Other things that annoy me: stupid touchpad. I don't know what's wrong with it. The two-finger gestures or whatever is horribly broken. It's slow compared to my mouse. Computer is heavy for its size. Loaded with HP crapware (although I suppose that's to be expected with any laptop these days). Wifi button: I don't know if it's JUST ME, but I've had the immense displeasure of using two of these things within the past few months, and the wireless button on BOTH machines have crapped out on me. Unhappy coincidence??tl;drIf you're looking for a good business laptop, look elsewhere!! Don't believe the insulting, hyperbolic praise this product has received on other sites. You can find better hardware for a better price. Also, the promise of "ultra portability" is an egregious lie.
-	Bought a dud, don't live in the states so couldn't mail it back in time a total waste of money. Never buying electronics off amazon again.
+	I got this MacBook Pro 2 weeks agoIt Came OX S LionIts a bit heavy but i still Love itand a free update of iPhoto
+	I've used Mac machines - mostly laptops - since 1986. My Macbook purchased in 2006 still works great, but wanted to upgrade and use it as a backup in the event it bites the dust (I live in another country where the environment is harsh and hardware costs more). The Macbook Pro 13.3 inch, now the entry level Apple hard drive laptop, does everything well that I need from multi-lingual word processing, producing songs and movies, photo management to everyday functions like web browsing and listening to audio files. You get more bang for your buck on this unit than on the earlier Macbooks. The Lion OS it runs on is sleek. The only drawback (which probably is ultimately a technological plus) is their cutting Rosetta - unlike earlier operating systems, Lion does not process the older Power PC software, which simply means the cost of software upgrades to more streamlined products. Amazon gave me the best price for the unit and delivered it fast.
+	It may be used, but it had been cleaned, it works perfectly, it augments my Mac desk-top. I am NOT computer naive, I bought this as an inexpensive second computer, and I am very happy. it's a sturdy businessman's lap-top, and was built to hold up. So even as a used machine I would recommend this as even your primary if all you needed was a good computer. Well worth the price!
-	The speakers are such poor quality that I have to turn them waaay down just to watch a video of people talking or else you'll hear static as though the speakers will give out soon.My other big gripe is that the screen doesn't tilt back past 90 degrees so unless you keep you laptop at chin level, it's really uncomfortable to look at.Sure, it's fast and light and looks great, but in this day and age, there are plenty of other models that are just as good and don't have these problems. CHOOSE A DIFFERENT LAPTOP. (HP even has some models that are comparable and better for around the same price).
+	Description honest and accurate. Shipped ahead of schedule, properly protected and ready for work. Windows 8 is unlike any prior version of windows. takes awhile to become accustom to all the new proccedures.
+	PRO:+ Track Pad+ No Trial Software+ Battery Life (I get around 5 or 6 hours on a charge)+ Incremental Backups with Time Machine (You can use almost any external HD instead Apple's expensive Time Capsule)+ Support is Awesome (Nuff said)CON:- No HDMI out- USB Ports too close togetherI ordered it here at Amazon, really a great price: http://amzn.to/11k59os
+	muy bueno, entrega rapida y sin problemas. El producto es uno de los mejores que existen! no hay comparación con ninguno
+	As with any Macbook Pro, it's shiny and beautiful and it works pretty fast. I used to only use PCs and this is my first personal Apple computer and I love it. Of course, you have to download Adobe yourself and then purchase Microsoft Office and all that jazz. It has yet to disappoint me. It is not too heavy compared to other laptops and goes with me everywhere. Invest in a case if you want to keep it a beauty though (so shallow).
+	Plain and simple, the 13" MacBook Pro w/ Core i5 processor is excellent at being what it's supposed to be...a laptop!  I spent months researching laptops.  I wanted something full powered (core i5) in a simplistic 13" form factor, with great battery life.  I went back and forth between some of the new 'Ultrabooks' such as the Asus Zenbook & Toshiba Portege.  They were tempting, but a big turn off to me was the limited processing power and shallow feel to the keyboard.  In the end I came down to the Lenovo U400 and this MacBook Pro.  An excellent Black Friday deal got be the U400 for around $850, so I took the plunge.  Without going into details, the end result was a return within a week and my ordering of this fine computer.What really sold me on the MacBook Pro was it's ability to thrive at being a laptop.  I personally do not feel there is a better laptop out there for the reasons in which I will list shortly.  Now I will start off by saying that I am not an Apple fan simple because they're Apple.  Now, that said, here are the reasons that sold me:1.  The simplistic, all aluminum case in a 13" form factor.2.  The keyboard is second to none for laptops.3.  The touch pad is a dream to use.4.  The battery life is top notch for a full featured laptop.5.  It has the little extras such as back lit keyboard and SD reader built in.Notice I did not mention anything about the Mac OS.  Up until I purchased this computer, I had very little experience with the Mac OS, so I was a little hesitant.  I have a fairly technical background and knack for tinkering with my computers, so I figured how hard could it be to learn?  To my surprise, it was a little frustrating the first week or two, but after that all I can say is that it simply makes sense.  Things work in the way that they should work.  Does this create some limitations on what you can do in comparison to a more open Windows? Yes, certainly.  But at the same time, I've learned that I really don't need to do those tiny little things I was fussing over.  Some people will never be fans of Apple or their OS, and that's understandable.  But coming from an avid Windows user and someone a little more technically inclined than the average person, I can honestly say it's a pleasure to use the Mac OS.My only tiny gripe is that Apple still refuses to incorporate HDMI.  I'd love to hook my MacBook Pro up to my external monitor for those times the extra screen real estate could be used.  There are plenty of adapters out there though to make this happen still.  I just wish it didn't take an adapter or special cable.So far so good.  I highly recommend the 13" Core i5 MacBook Pro to anyone looking for a new laptop!
-	I just got off the phone with support, for the second time in 3 computer with ASUS. I have the G74S and it has never worked properly. When I purchased this laptop I was under the impression that it had a 3 year warranty, and it turns out it has only 1 year. now the piece of garbage doesnt work and I have to PAY for repairs as well as ship it on my own dime to get it fixed. STAY away from ASUS. I have purchased 3 of there computers and 2 have have gone bad.
-	I just returned my one week old brand new Macbook Pro.  The display failed after one week of light use.  So much for the high quality of Apple products. Don't flame since this is my third Apple computer since switching.  Thanks goodness for Amazon's great return policy and their great service.
-	IT STARTED ACTING STRANGE AFTER WEEK 1, THEN BY WEEK 3 IT COMPLETELY IMPLODED - THE ONLY THING LEFT WAS A GIANT ERROR MESG THAT SAID THE ENTIRE CHROME OS NEEDED TO BE RE-INSTALLED (which obviously only the Seller would be able to do)  and I've not rec'd a single email response from seller regarding returning for refund!  I still have it sitting in original box with no use for it at all :(
+	This is my fourth 15" MacBook Pro in 10 years.  I buy the same model every time, new and improved.  This is the first one I have some qualms about.1) Glossy screen stinks.  Too much glare.  Glossy screens are for casual users, not professionals.2) I need to buy a dongle to hook this up to an external screen.  That's ridiculous.  A dongle, what is this 1988?3) One day the battery will conk out and because of Steve Jobs' neurotic tick about external batteries, I'll have to shell out 250 bucks or so to get a new one. Harrumph!4) Other than that, the machine is fast, slick and wonderful, a significant improvement over the one I bought three years ago.
-	I bought this laptop 5 months ago because a friend gave it great reviews.  At first there was no problem with the computer, but after a month there was a problem with the batteries getting charged.  I've owned many computers in the past and I did all I knew to trouble shoot before getting support.  After a while, I couldn't figure it out, so I went to their website for support.I've been to so many websites for support in the past and thought it would be simple to get some type of customer service.  Boy was I wrong!  I left an email about my problem, but after a couple days, I got tired waiting for a response.  I tried to find an authorized local repair service for my laptop through their website but the page where I was supposed to find an authorized repair service kept on saying that there is no local repair service in the area even if the drop down menu lists at least 3 in my state.So I finally found a phone number to call. It was their 24 hour hotline. I called and was directed to the right extension for laptop repair.  I waited 20 minutes before someone answered the phone. The customer service rep took my number and e-mail, and while I was trying to get him the serial number, I got cut off.  I could hear him but he couldn't hear me.  He apologized that he couldn't hear me and told me to call him back!  He took my number in the beginning of our conversation but he didn't even try to use it to call me back!  Now I had to call back and wait another 20 minutes!  But this time, I just got cut off after 20 minutes!I will never ever ever buy an ASUS again!  This is the worst computer company I have ever dealt with!
-	I am on my second laptop now. the first laptop came with the UPS package in perfect shape, however, the box for the laptop was soaked in the corner. battery was wet and laptop felt damp to the touch. Decided to return that one. Second laptop came a few days and most has been well... However, today i was charging the battery after discharging it only about 15% and it said that it was at 95%, plugged in but not charging. Which is essentially windows way of saying the battery is screwed!... Not only that but BOTH the laptops have Black lines on the screen that REALLY become noticeable when you see darker colours! :(  I did not have the best run with ASUS a few years ago and i really wanted to give them a shot again. Im hoping it was just amazons poor shipping that was to blame! :,(
+	As the title says this was a good buy. I'm glad I bought this. The price isn't too bad considering it's a Mac. It's a quick little machine and so far runs great.
-	The only good thing I can say about this system is it has a nice keyboard.Turned it on for the first time and it sounded like a jet taking off the fan(s) were so loud.The fans were constantly running & the keyboard was getting quite warm.Day 2 it gave up the ghost. Network card fried. No ethernet, no WiFi.  I suspect that the unit over heated and fried the network card.Amazon sent two UPS pickups, both with different tracking numbers.  It did get picked up by the first guy who got there. The second guy kept trying for 3 days to do his pickup.  Amazon did credit my credit card with in a couple of days to their credit.I've had a Dell laptop before that is still going strong after 7 years.  This one was just poor design with the internals from the word go.I now have a similar system made by Toshiba with AMD dual core CPUs instead of the Intel Quad core CPU the Dell unit had.  The Toshiba was $75 cheaper at Walmart.  The system is just as fast, the fan hardly runs at all and it is whisper quiet.I would definitely not recommend a Dell product, this comes from some one who is retired after 30 years in the IT field doing just about everything.
+	Laptop better than advertised. Packaging was perfect. More hard drive than expected. Fast,intuitive, and responsive. Definetly considering another for my wife to enjoy!
+	Esse notebook é muito bom, mas não compre se quiser ter um tablet pra levar para cima e pra baixo, pois ele é pesado e esquenta muito. Deve-se ter cuidado com a tela que parece ser bem frágil no encaixe que é apenas no meio, o que as vezes faz a tela ficar meio bamba a qualquer toque na lateral da tela. O touch é muito bom, preciso e nem uso a caneta. Com o windows 8 ele ficou perfeito, a inicialização é muito rápida, poucos segundos. No mais, gosto dos Lenovo pela qualidade dos materiais e esse não é diferente. Só faltou um HDMI nessa joça. O custo benefício é muito real se comprado no exterior, no Brasil esse notebook sairá lá pelos seis mil reais, um absurdo. Nem valeria esse valor se já viesse com a base. Aqui está bem barato pelos benefícios.
+	I expected lightening fast start up and response with an intel i7 processor, but I can't tell any difference from the i5 that I had earlier.  I am disappointed since this computer cost twice as much as the i5. Maybe all that preloaded software slows things down.  If so, HP and Microsoft and Intel should stop preloading stuff we don't need.
+	The good old apple product. You can never get it wrong with apple. This is one of them. I got it more than right.
-	Works beautifully if plugged into the wall.  On battery it disconnects every ten minutes or the second i plug in my iphone.  All the known power saving settings problems are addressed: setup F2 to latest defaults, latest wireless adapter configured so it does not let windows disconnect for power saving, windows 7 up to date.  Case 1778026 if other Asus techs are reading this.  The last Asus tech I got assigned to (I talked to three because they will not wait five minutes to see if their solution works) , who in all fairness did wait at my request, after seeing that her last attempt did not work, said that they could not do anything else about it.  When I said that there is no option for me but to return it then, she agreed, apologizing.  Replacement was not suggested, which leads me to believe that this is a known problem for which they do not have a fix yet.  I have two new $400 HP pavilions notebooks with same power working beautifully on my home network, with windows 7, albeit a bit uglier looking.  That tells you that it's nice for a notebook to be beautiful with all solid hardware, but does not do you any good if it cannot perform a basic function, in this case connect to wireless, consistently in the marketplace.  I'm glad I bought it thru Amazon, their return process is flawless.
-	But I am telling you that my experience has been AWFUL with HP. We bought a pretty expensive laptop a year and a half ago. 2 weeks after buying it the plastic broke off the front. A year after we bought it the built in mic and camera broke. CS hung up on me after hours of being transferred and on hold. Finally they said the warranty expired a few weeks earlier they couldn't help me. Now 1 and 1/2 years later our hard drive is dead. I bought a Dell in 2004 it is still running today. Please do no buy HP products. They DO NOT stand behind the quality of their products or value their customers.
+	I was not sent the login password for the computer (which is frequently asked for when uploading/downloading new programs). This means that I cannot log out because I will not be able to log back in to my settings. Apart from that, the laptop works fine...
-	keyboard is unpredictable, and the touchpad is placed poorly so you are always moving the cursor when you are typing.  The multifinger motions are unreliable at best.  Don't forget because of the UEFI you wont get another OS installed.  No cd drive, no backup disks.But it is a nice size...
-	I had major problems with the trackpad from the beginning. It had been clicking from the bottom of the machine on its own since I got it. Sent it in to Lenovo once. They sent it back and said "nothing is wrong with this :) " I sent the machine immediately back after weeks of waiting. Once again they told me "There is nothing wrong with it." I called them and explained the situation for the third time. They FLAT OUT told me that nothing was wrong with the machine and said there was nothing they could do to help me. DON'T BUY from Lenovo ever. They will REFUSE to help you out.
+	This laptop is a real bargain.  It's sleek looking with the power that you'll need for most business and video/graphic editing needs.  I'd been haunting Toshiba's website for months, looking for deals -- and they don't come close to what is offered here.Included in your package are recovery disks for Windows 8.1 Pro.  I wanted Windows 7 Pro -- which is hard to find on a new laptop these days -- but will probably upgrade at some point.Turn this machine on and you're ready to be productive.  You won't have to uninstall a bunch of bloatware.  You're getting a clean, fast system.
+	thank you very much it is good i can bye again from you when needed and sorry for responding so late and have a MERRY CHRISTMAS
-	First I ordered a similar laptop from amazon on their cyber Monday deal for $200 which was awesome until about 7 hrs after I got my shipping and order confirmation I get an e-mail from amazon saying my order was cancelled due to "mispricing"  so I call amazon and get nowhere with their awfull customer service that can barely speak/understand English after that I decided to send them a lovely e-mail stated how I felt and that I was canceling my 3 other orders I had made that day equaling about $500 , they e-mail me back stating that they don't even sell the laptop and it was a mistake which isn't my problem If you post something on your main deals page for cyber Monday you better honor it which after about 5 emails and 1 phone call they finally did and next day aired me this laptop which was a Christmas present and come to find out after it was gifted the dumb thing wont even turn on! so I called asus customer service which was worse than amazons and they send me a shipping label to send it back to get fixed so I do that I just got it back today and guess what.. it still doesn't work!!!!! WTH im done with amazon and Asus save yourself some heartache and buy a apple product atleast they have excellent customer service
-	This isn't JUST HP, but we can start with them.  So they ship you this computer, but withhold the 3 OS and Restore discs that would cost a $1 during manufacturing to package with the computer.  Then they want $16 for the discs, postage, and handling later; except most people don't know they need them until their machine is in a bad way.  So then when you need them the most, your waiting for delivery.  So by "saving the planet" they are wasting more fuel, packaging, and time by SELLING to you what is already yours.  Sure, on some machines you can burn your own, but when you get a new machine, with new antivirus that says "load immediately" which then crashes the OS prior to building one system restore point and your machine is toast, then what?
+	My family has always been a Mac family. We have videos of me sitting at our old Mac Tower and typing random letters into Indesign. I don't actually have my MacBook Pro yet, but my mom has one and as do my friends. I have to say, the MacBook Pro is incredible! It's fast, though will occasionally freeze, the battery life is awesome unless you're running many complicated applications and other fancy schmancy things at once, and the physical computer is really nice. The keyboard is really fun to type on and the trackpad is awesome. I can't wait to get my Mac!
+	I purchased the new Macbook Pro 15" (from Amazon, thank you) the very first weekend it was released.  I produce videos for my company and felt like this was a super upgrade in power for me.The machine is now having problems with hard freezes when I try to render video.  The system fans start to rapidly build to around 6000 rpm and the machine goes into a state where the only option is a hard reset.  The machine is REALLY hot too.  At this point, I have noticed other postings on the Apple forums which suggest that this is a problem others are reporting about the new line.I realize I'm not offering much background at this time but I wanted to make it known in case anyone is considering a purchase.  Here is my immediate take:1)  If you feel you can benefit from the horsepower, I would definitely recommend this machine.2)  If you don't need it TODAY, wait about 30 days before purchasing and see how this plays out in the forums.I have an appointment with the Apple Genius Bar and I fully anticipate they will want to replace it.  Despite this issue, I still LOVE my Apple gear and will always recommend them.UPDATE:  I noted in later postings below that I have learned a little more about my issue.  As a result, I am revising my rate to be 5 stars since the problem appears to be related to a non-Apple application.
-	Cheap Chinese Computer should be the title of this laptop.  Plastic keyboard and crappy mousepad. Pay the extra and buy an asus, never buying a Lenovo again. Stay away from this brand, this product and this company.
-	I didn't purchase this from Amazon.  It was a spur of the moment purchase from Best Buy.  I bought it, ran home, opened the box and read the welcome pamphlet that said that the battery was fully charged and to just press the power key.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I then plugged it in and it didn't come on immediately and then it came on w/the power light glowing orange.  B/c I bought this laptop precisely b/c of its advertised battery life, I unplugged it and packed it up and went to BB to exchange it.  They said that they couldn't do an exchange (they could do a return) unless they ran the diagnostics and found a problem and they did - it was an electrical charging issue (?voltage).  They got another laptop and asked if I wanted to open it at the store and I thought that was a great idea.  Opened the box - again NOTHING.  They ran the diagnostics and diagnosed the same issue.  I just gave up on this laptop.  When I got home I googled the web and found all kinds of complaints about charging the battery.  I just wonder how many people who buy this laptop take it home and don't realize that a dead battery signifies a problem, charge it and then have all kinds of issues.  What a ripoff!
+	It's everything I expected it to be.  Easy to use.  Easy to set up.  Lightweight, compared to my old one.
-	I was very excited about this laptop B&O; speakers, 1080p screen, great keyboard, fast ssd, great aluminum build quality. it met all my expectations for about 4 days (4.5 stars for a few days). On my first zenbook prime I had a speaker rattle and the enter key wasn't set correctly, no big deal these things happen just swapped it out for another. second one great speakers but 2 weeks later the track pad just stopped the computer didn't even see it in device panel, at this point I was getting a little upset so I called asus they took the laptop and 2 weeks later I got a replacement (no loaner laptop 2 weeks no computer failed term paper being able to only work on my ipad fyi asus) new laptop comes in the mail now the trackpad works but 5 keys on the keyboard will not type and the speakers rattle again. sent it in again for another 2 weeks got a new laptop and this one has some keys that don't work speaker rattles and trackpad is intermittent. DO NOT BUY ITS GREAT ON PAPER BUT ASUS SUPPORT IS THE WORST IVE DELT WITH (incredibly rude, unhelpful, and unapologetic) AND THE COMPUTER HAS THE SAME QUALITY CONTROL AS SOVIET RUSSIAin summery-Bang and olufsen speakers not B&O; just branded I have B&O; speakers in two Audis those are amazing the laptops are quiet and rattle NOT B&O; the Danish would be ashamed of the name on here-Screen great resolution no problems except backlight bleeds around corners-best laptop keyboard I ever typed on for the week it worked (edit: Lenovo yoga has better keyboard but no light)-SSD not nearly as fast as competing models from acer, Lenovo, apple, Samsung-build quality only external, feels good internals probably Russian-power cord incredibly short, no longer option available as with competitors (bring extension cable its REALLY SHORT)-customer service is a joke-asus refused to refund my purchase I filled out paperwork for lemon law and am in the process of review with my lawyer (thanks bro for going to law school) (CUSTOMER REP CALLED ME AN 'IDOT' FOR THE TRACKPAD ISSUE, TRACKPAD WAS NOT TURNED OFF IT WAS DISCONNECTED ON THE INSIDE)(went ape-sh** on him)-Best Buy stopped carrying this model I asked why they said that almost everyone they sold where returned within two weekssave your time just purchased a Lenovo idea pad yoga and is much better  (faster, touchscreen, loud clear speakers, long power adapter, great build quality) even called their support with a fake issue and the where friendly and where willing to send me a replacement laptop before I sent mine in (They understand you have to work on their equipment daily! what an idea)I will never buy anything asus makes again they cannot compete in the us in any serious way with issues like this, (people hold grudges in the sates and in Europe asus maybe Taiwan is different but your selling in the us get your sh** together). I have the Lenovo now, now I just need to get my $1K back for this inferior pos had it for 3 months they had it more than me
-	As per Betty J's review, I too ran into a very similar problem.  Was not happy with the computer.  The sound mainly came from the subwoofer and not the actual speakers and the subwoofer is not centrally located on the computer so it made for a very awful audio experience. This was a problem that you could only find out about after opening the box and testing the product thus making it ineligible for return. According to the return policy of Adorama, the company apparently selling this product, they don't accept any opened products without only giving a maximum 50% refund. Now I'm down $700 and VERY unhappy. When I contacted Amazon, they backed up the seller 100%. I will never buy from this company again and frankly, I will be less likely to use Amazon for buying things as well.
+	I bought this laptop because I wanted a change from my regular windows machines. I had heard about how well Mac is designed , and when it arrived - I got to see it myself.It is a very well designed product. It definitely does not heat up as my windows machine ( I own hp, dell, toshiba... ) . It has a great OS and great built in software ( iSuite ).. Easy to setup, and then begin working on it. It is great for viewing photographs and editing them. It is far superior in color reproduction than any of my other machines - finally some justice done to my photographs. Multitouch and gestures are awsome - windows machines are no way near it. Good sound reproduction - i love it with my bose on... The webcam is much better than competing machines today.Being a machine, I cannot say that it is perfect - it froze on me yesterday. It is still a great effort in inching towards one.
+	Got this macbook after using Toshiba. What a difference!!Very convenient to use and has excellent processing speed. I love that it doesn't get heated even after extensive usage. Recommend it for others to try.
-	I was liking this laptop a lot until I brought it more than 30 feet away from my home wireless AP.See my blog post:[...]
+	This laptop really needs 2 GB of RAM if you're expecting to get the best performance out of Windows Vista. Be prepared to do an upgrade (this is very easy, even for the non-techie).  Also, the A135 tends to run very hot - so I recommend purchasing an external USB fan, like this one.Targus AWE81US Chill Hub and Chill Mat with 4-port Hub for Laptops up to 17-Inch - BlackMy assumption is that you'll end up with one of these computers the same way I did - either someone will give you one, or you'll find it dirt-cheap on CL or the auction website that starts with the letter "e." Brand-new laptops can be purchased so cheaply these days that there's no serious reason to buy a Toshiba Satellite A135 and pay $200 for it, but if you stumble upon one for less than $100, it's probably worth buying, if you're looking for a light-duty laptop for grandma or very young kids who don't need the latest and greatest.Also, a fairly common problem, judging by comments/pleas for help posted on various internet message boards, is that many of these laptops bought used have a glitch regarding the bios being locked with a password. There's a complex fix, which is way beyond my skill level, involving a soldering iron and a paper clip. I just decided to live with the locked bios, meaning I can't get into the CMOS settings to change anything, which shouldn't be a massively big deal for most users.Edited, to note, FWIW, I performed a completely unremarkable memory upgrade to 2GB, but the introduction of a used 160 GB hard drive into the belly of the beast killed the lazy old b**ch. Even though the hard drive specs indicated it was a perfect match, something went wrong, and the patient died belly open on the operating table. I removed the new hard drive and reinserted the original one, and all of a sudden, there were bizarre error messages about a network card failure.Pfft. Cracking open the slots on the bottom of the case revealed a solder knocked loose, from what looks like the network card, which was most likely caused by the age of the laptop. A real FUBAR. I could buy a soldering iron and teach myself how to repair the damaged connection, but at the rate I'm going, I might end up burning the house down. So it was just time to say Sayonara, baby... you worthless old hag.
-	Ordered this product in November, It arrived without the webcam being detected. Attempted to re-install windows and install drivers. Webcam still is not detected...Sent the item back to Asus on 12/4. ASUS tech support promised me the item would be expedited. ( Nothing like a brand new machine not working the second it comes out of the box).  They received it 12/7 ( per fed-ex).. AS of today 12/17 they still have the machine and cannot give me any time as to when they will complete the repair.I will never be purchasing from ASUS again. When its all said and done I envision being without this machine for almost 1 month.  I do not expect brand new items to be malfunctioning upon delivery.  Upon googling this issue, the problem appears to be very common. Pathetic, Asus even knows of the issue when you call them. This is an obvious defect effecting numerous machines and they do nothing about it but waste my time.Customer support is located offshore and can provide ZERO details on anything. They are no better than a automated phone system.  I do not recommend the company.
-	Don't get this. It has the same wireless network card issues that the other versions of the xps15 have. It's not fixed.
+	This laptop came very quickly.  Even though it was wrapped in sufficient bubble paper for packaging the outside container was a prepaid box from the post office that looked like it had been through a Hurricane.  The computer had a few scuffs and scratches across the top but came up very quickly when turned on. So far it has been ok.
-	Acer kept my older laptop for a month in for repair before they told me they didn't have the part to fix it (a part available online from many many vendors for cheap).I wouldn't have even known they couldn't fix it until I went through two chats and a phone call with their support (ALL giving me different information).  They would have kept it indefinitely.Short answer: DO NOT BUY FROM THIS TERRIBLE COMPANY.  THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.Their only solution was for me to purchase a brand new computer from them.
+	Not real happy with windows 8 but laptop is great. Like the keys, number pad and the screen size is nice. Don't think I would be carrying anywhere but is great for home office use. Fast enough for me. Don't play games so couldn't really say anything about that but I am happy with my purchase.
+	Great value, fast shipping and amazing machine. It came with 2 GB of RAM and for about $50.00 I was able to quickly upgrade to 4 when I received the item. Will keep my eye out for them to offer more of these at such a great value!
-	Originally I wrote a great review for this laptop (the original review is located at the bottom of this one), but after owning it for 2.5 months my opinion has drastically changed.  Windows 8.1 does not work smoothly on this device. Before updating, check the Sony site, as there are specific drivers you have to download before you install the update.  Otherwise you will encounter many problems with the OS.  Also there is a problem with the touchpad.  After installing Windows 8.1, the mouse icon disappears from the screen on occasion.  The Sony tech said that the factory installed anti-virus software is the cause of the issue.  So those are the general issues that I believe plague this product.I have a ton of other issues that I believe are specific to my purchase.  Overall, I think my computer is severely defective.  It is currently at the Sony repair center for the second time since I purchased it.  I've spent hours on the phone with Sony tech support trying to get my computer to run smoothly and am beginning to think that I wasted a lot of money on this purchase.  In addition to the issues mentioned above, I've had problems with random lines/colors showing up on my display, the computer crashing unexpectedly, problems coming out of hibernation.  The list goes on...I really hope the problems I've experienced are due to an isolated incident of a defective product and is not a general problem that other have experienced.Original Review:This is not a comprehensive review, as I'm not a tech expert.  There are other reviews that cover the technical pros and cons of this computer very well.  I just wanted to add a few things...1) I've had this computer for about 3 weeks and I think the software updates have resolved the often reported wireless internet connectivity issues, as I haven't had many problems with it.2) This computer scratches very easily.  I received it in the mail one day prior to receiving my protective sleeve.  It got multiple scratches on it the first day from being placed in my tote bag with my school books.  I'm currently shopping for a skin to cover up the ugly scratches.3) Lastly... I'm amazed at how light it is and how fast it starts up!
+	Apple has once again outdone themselves with a superior product!I replaced my late model 2007 white MacBook with this late 2011 model MacBook Pro and I couldn't be more pleased! It is a beautiful design, runs really fast and is very quiet. Has great RAM and the hard drive space is perfect for a laptop. I work often with the Adobe Suite and it handles it with ease.Set up was super easy (as is all Apple products).Love the backlit keyboard. If I'm working in the dark, it's nice to know where my keys are. I suggest you get a silicone keyboard protector for your keys so they don't wear down and stay like new. You can still see the light shining through even with the silicone keyboard over the keys.Love the Lion OS!Perfect for a beginner, novice, or professional!
-	I am a proud owner of 2 of these machines. One with guarilla glass with only pen input, and one with pen and multi-touch (without Guarilla glass. I keep seeing sellers overpricing striped down versions of these x230t laptops with i5's and i7s with no webcam, finger print reader and only 8gb of ram, and some selling with no bluetooth! thats retarded. there are many x230t selling for $1,200 with i7, 360gb HD, 4gb ram WITH bluetooth, webcam, fingerprint reader for $1,200. Just buy 2 sticks of coarsair 8gb ram and install yourself. Bottom line these unit advertised here should only be selling for about $1,100 with these stripped down options. Check New egg, amazon, or just google these and find a way better deal, with better setting for only $1,200. aggravates me seeing people get ripped off
+	Mac Book Pro 13 (early 2011 and late 2011) are excellent laptops. It works really well. The pricing is very competitive. You will fall in love with it in no time. If you could stretch by a few 100 dollars I highly recommend you should replace your Windows laptop with this one.My review mainly talks about the difference I have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro.I bought mine from Apple Store the day it was released as Amazon didn't have it yet.Processor - When compared to my 3 week old Early 2011 edition there I barely experience any difference in performance (2.3 GHz v/s 2.4 GHz).Hard disk - The new editions gives you more hard disk space (500GB instead of 320GB) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk. I always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times. So, the hard disk capacity really doesn't matter to me.Issues I have encountered so far on the Late 2011 Edition (new one):Fan noise: The fan made a constant hissing noise in the background. So, I took it back to the apple store and they  narcissist genius bar staff) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up.(Beware, their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is. I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a "different" computer. Yeah, of course smarty pants "fix it now")Software - Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple (which I promptly did).I think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and I need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed. I will be patient for few months.Overall,at this point I feel for 100 bucks more you will get a newer hardware but it is not drastically different and you will not miss anything if you want to save some money and want to stick with the Early 2011 edition.Enjoy your mac book pro !!
+	For the price, a good product and what I expected.  Few of the keys are worn but that was expected being a refurbished product.  Laptop came as advertised.
-	I bought this Toshiba laptop 3 years ago. Since then, my screen started flickering then it just went completely white, now its doing a long flash that prevents me from doing my work properly or watch a movie in peace. My keyboard is not working anymore and it's just pushing off an odd heat now. Looking at other people's comments, we all have the same issues. This is an unreliable machine and I would NEVER buy another Toshiba device again. Horrible! And here i thought HP was the worst! DO NOT BUY!
+	This machine is not a performance powerhouse by any means, but it is a fairly priced good quality machine.We bought this for our daughter about a month ago directly from HP, and it meets all of her needs.  Yes, the screen could be higher resolution, the processor could be faster, and the hard drive speed could be faster, but all those things would add a lot to the price.The battery life on this computer has been about 5 hours during normal use.  We've only had an opportunity to fully test that (going from full to empty) twice, so it may vary depending on what you are doing and your settings.This machine has Windows 8 installed on it, which is true of almost all new computers now.  We definitely prefer most things about Windows 7 to Windows 8, although some things have been improved such as the task manager.  (The task manager is that program that opens when you hit Control-Shift-Escape that tells you what programs and processes are running and how you computer is performing.  They've added a ton of functionality to that feature of Windows.)  Things that we don't like, such as the new start screen, aren't that big of a deal to get around.  Overall, Windows 8 isn't a reason to dislike this computer, in my opinion.  It takes a little getting used to, but overall it has as much good as it does bad, and we will eventually get used to or find work arounds for the few bad things.This machine is a good value.  It isn't blazing fast, but does web surfing and office applications just fine.  If you are looking for a gaming machine, look elsewhere and plan to spend double what this laptop costs.  If you are looking for a well made, basic machine, with a 17 inch screen than you won't be disappointed here.
-	The screen went out August 10th.  Sent back to Dell and they received it August 13th.  Well here it is a month later and they still have it.  AND every time I call them (India) to see where it is and whats going on they tell me they have to escalate the case.  When I ask them what that means they dont answer me.  After 5 times calling, last week they finally told me that the screen needed to be replaced and part was finally in stock.  Well called again and again they have to escalate case.  This is my first Alienware purchase since Dell bought them and I have never dealt with such incompetance with a $2000.00 product.  I personally think they lost it and I will be filing a claim with them at the end of the week.  Save yourself time and aggrivation and order anything else but a Dell/Alienware.
+	This model supports virtualization - which I use for certain business transactions that run under Win 7.  I have always been an Ubuntu fan and everything functions extremely well on this machine.  When backing up the drive on this machine, I used GParted and connected to my hard-wired networked server and issued the "dd if=/dev/sda ..." command.  For some reason, it would not boot Clonezilla - just a tip.
-	If you are looking for a laptop that can do more than web searches look elsewhere. Don't waste your money.
+	I switched to the 13" MacBook Pro from a 15" Toshiba Satellite. My Toshiba was only 15 months old but it seemed a lot older - it was very loud (fans and other noises), very heavy, and very fragile. I purchased the refurbished MacBook straight from Apple and it came to my door 2 days later in NEW condition. Start ups are faster, the shortcuts are amazing, the customization (and ease of customization) is amazing. The learning curve is present, but give yourself a week with Mac OS X and you'll forget Windows even exists.There really is nothing bad to say about the machine but I do have one complaint and it's not really about the computer itself, its about iWork. I downloaded the free trials of iWork and Microsoft Office to test out the compatibility of iWork to Office and I was less than impressed. Pages documents would translate to Word and sometimes do funky things with my formatting.All in all I give this machine a 10 out of 10. I am a grad student and use the MacBook mainly for school (papers, research, email, and the like). I will probably never go back to Windows. I encourage you to at least head to BestBuy or an Apple store and try this amazing machine out.One more thing. I would recommend just buying the base 4GB memory version and then upgrading the RAM later on your own. I upgraded my MacBook to 8GB of RAM with the Crucial kit that I purchased through Amazon. It literally took 7 minutes to install. Super easy and it only cost about $45 (compared to Apples (I think) $200 upgrade option).
+	This is exactly what I wanted in a laptop. I have the 21 inch MAC for home use and couldn't wait until I could buy a Mac Book. I have been out of town where I couldn't get internet service, but was able to write letters with TextEdit to copy when I returned home. I am so new to having this laptop, that all I can say is, I love it and it was worth the wait to get the Apple Mac Book Pro to go with my Big Mac at home!!
-	I am using this laptop for 2 years. This computer generates a lot of heat and time lag is occurred frequently. This is my second SONY laptop and will be last... There is an word in Japan that SONY will be out of order within 2 years.
+	Buena resolución, súper portatil y fácil de manejar. Llegó en perfecto estado y en la caja original con todos los accesorios.
-	This computer has been a complete waste of money.  Everytime you use the touchpad the screen changes and there is no way to get back.  I have used a lot of computers, but this has to be the worst.When I called HP for help, I was told that there was no leaving Windows 8 and that I needed to go and buy a new computer.  This represents a new low in customer service.I can only hope that HP ceases to exist quickly so no one else is subject to their inferior products.
-	I purchased this at the Staples Store, here in PA.Everything seemed great at first, Wi-Fi fast, resolution great and then...2 months into it, the mouse stopped working, and then wouldn't start working again.  Third month into using it, the whole screen is black, power button won't turn off.  I took it back to Staples and they ran a check, and then told me, I had to call Toshiba.  I called Toshiba and I have to return it for $24.00 to get it repaired.  I shouldn't have to pay a dime, but if I want my, supposedly brand new computer, which cost me over $400.00 computer running again, I have to fork over the money, and I am now waiting on the box for them to send me, to ship it back in!This is simply unacceptable and unbelievable.  I would never buy another Toshiba, nor would I suggest one to anyone!I will update, after I get it back, and see how it works then.(Update)  I got it back, after a week, and it is working great now. It has super fast speed, and many, many apps, which I don't use.  I just use it, to surf the internet, and load my pics on it, that's it, can't tell you too much more about it, because of my computer use.
-	I purchased this laptop on 4/5/11 directly from Amazon and received a product affected by the sandy bridge recall.  I was hesitant after reading some of the other reviews, but went ahead and ordered out of good faith.  Upon opening the package, I noticed that there were no recertification stickers to be found anywhere.  After finally getting the Asus support website to load, I confirmed that my laptop was indeed affected by the recall.Edit 1:  Amazon is unable to exchange the laptop (not that I'd trust them to ship a re-certified model), but offered a refund.  This requires me to pay for shipping back to them, at which time they estimate the refund will process in 10-15 business days.  Not exactly thrilled about having my money tied up so long thanks to their willingness to ship a pre-recall laptop.Before I dealt with Amazon's support, I attempted to do an expedited recall through Asus.  Asus support is by far the worst customer service experience I've ever had.  They couldn't fathom that I had formatted and performed a clean Win7 install prior to realizing the laptop was affected by the recall.  Who wouldn't want their notoriously bad software, right?  The CSR talked down to me while possessing the trouble shooting skills of an infant.  They couldn't even figure out how to create a case number to begin processing the recall.  You'd think that would be something they've dealt with quite frequently as of late.
-	Look, I'm not computer savvy, but:I can't take that everytime I scroll sideways an entire different screen comes up.I just wanted a simple computer and this is not it....way too 'fancy' for its own good.I just want a normal computer that I can scroll around normally.Honestly, if this computer was 'mysteriously' totaled tomorrow, I'd spare a tear and get a dell or a mac.
-	I purchased this laptop two weeks ago from Bestbuy worth $1049 (package with Neatgear Push-to-Tv and Kaspersky Anti-Virus) to replace our 3 year old Dell Inspiron PC. My wife fell in love with the style which is similar to MacBook Pro. Initially, I don't have any issues with regards to the speed and performance which I expected considering that it has Intel Turbo Boost Technology. However, when I tried to manually install several of my applications into this laptop using CDs, there are times that the system doesn't detect the CD drive (even before I insert the CD). Whenever I encountered this issue, I just restarted the system and it all come back to normal. After that, my wife and I continued our "break-in" process by testing several apps, video streaming and playing music while surfing the net, chatting through skype etc... Then came the unexpected... Everytime we play music (either through CD or harddisk)/watching movie/making calls through Skpe, there's always a point where a squeking sound originates from the speaker. A distortive sound always takes place in random timings. We also not satisfied with the sound of the speaker in general. Even if we adjust the volume to its maximum value, you can barely hear the sound (add to the fact that the distortive sound still takes place). After three days, we decided to return it back even if we pay for the restoking fee. What we cannot stomach is the performance of this laptop compare to its value. At the Bestbuy store, we were directed to the Geek Squad section to check if our claim is valid (we told the sales person that it is a defective laptop to avoid paying the 15% restocking fee). After seeing the item that I am returning and informing him of the problem, the Geek Squad guy didn't bother to check/open the item. He pointed me directly to the cashier to get my replacement. At that point, we decided to get the MacBook Pro which only cost $1199. We didn't mind if we added a bit more as long as my wife and I are both happy with what we purchased.
-	14 months after buying the QX-410 from Best Buy, the battery died. I went back to Best Buy and was told that the warranty had run out and the only thing they could do was replace the mother board for $700 since the battery was soldered onto the motherboard. So instead of a $40 replacement battery, it's $700 for a motherboard. Bottom line: DON'T BUY THIS ONE! When it's going to cost $700 a year for a battery, nothing else matters.
+	Bought this for my wife for Christmas and it works as advertised. Laptop is a great performer for the value.Worked flawlessly out of the box.Sorry about the previous user mishaps, but for me it worked as a charm.
+	Vendor answered my questions promptly and shipped the computer quickly.  It worked just as indicated and I have had no issues installing new software or using the laptop.  Would definitely purchase from this vendor again.I have this exact model already and use it for work so I was aware of the specs and its capability.
+	Was a birthday present for my best friend who is in college. Have to say the reaction was more than I expected. So I'm HAPPY!
-	Laptop is the worst I've ever had; not sure why; it could be the Windows 8.  It will barely connect to the internet and then moves so slowly it is ridiculous.  I know it is the laptop, because I have another one that sails along, as well as my phone and my tablet.  But this one is a darn parking lot.  It is the only laptop with Windows 8 so it could be either the Windows 8 or the laptop; but to me, it doesn't matter which.  I would not recommend this product
+	If there is one day, everyone on earth owns a Mac, it is no surprise to me at all! This device is so awesome! I am really glad I switch from Windows7 to Mac system! So fast!!And the shipment is also fast.............. It arrives one day earlier!! Good job UPS!!!!!!!!
+	This is my second MacBook. It's very fast, a lot of storage, I love the new App Store for MacBook, bright screen, backlit keyboard is awesome. It is SO easy to get dirty though.. like it really gets on my nerves sometimes. I put my first scratch on the back, so PLEASE buy a cover for it because it is really easy to scratch.The only regret I have, is I wish I would've spend a little more and got the 15" instead.
+	Love the backlit keyboard. Fast, Great monitor quality, Love Win 7 PRO, but glad the 8.1 CD came with it in case I decide to upgrade. Great battery life.
+	A typically stylish and easy to set up Apple product. It's light and the screen resolution is good. I wish the software came on disks as well as pre-loaded though.
+	Bought this for our GIS person to use. So far it is performing well, as our team uses it over the next few months, I will write more about its quirks and capabilities.
-	I have had this laptop for only a couple months and it is still under warranty. The battery life is nice but I have already sent it in twice to be fixed.  The first time was because of a crashing issue and the second time was because a group of pixels in the screen died.  Each time I had to pay for shipping and was without a computer for more than a week.My real issue is that after getting the laptop back from the pixels issue, less than two days later more pixels died.  I called ACER customer support and they told me that I would have to pay for the screen to be replaced this time even though the laptop was still under warranty.  I find it unacceptable to be required to pay to replace something that they were just supposed to have fixed two days ago!
+	This laptop is an amazingly engineered machine, which beats every competitor I've tried or been acquainted with.  It is the very best.
-	Very disgusted with this company. I will NEVER, EVER purchase another product from this company--EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I had to return 2 computers within a few weeks due to manufactures defect and to make matters worse, I was told by ASUS representative to return the 2nd computer to Best Buy (where I purchased). Best buy told me they wouldn't send it back to ASUS to be serviced, that it was my responsibility. I was also told by another of ASUS reps that i would be refunded for shipping costs. NOW, I am on hold being told another story (yet again) from ASUS rep. that I will NOT be reimbursed the $20.00 for shipping. This company has THE WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE and exports their calling centers to poorly trained reps. You will be given courteous service but uninformed, inflexible, unhelpful, and simply poor customer service. The product is flimsy and you won't even be getting your 1200 dollars worth of product. The first computer I had, the screen went blank within 3 days. The second: the W, R, and SHIFT keys stopped working. Stay away!!
-	There are plenty of good things to say about this laptop/Ultrabook (NP540U3C-A01CB) but they're irrelevant because the Intel hardware/software doesn't allow you to connect to wifi. More specifically, the wifi is very spotty and if you're able to connect to wifi internet, it will lose the connection immediately. If you conduct an internet search about this, you'll see that it is a widespread issue. I've owned this product for over a year and have tried many times to fix the connectivity issue without any progress. Samsung isn't helping either, it seems like they know they sold a faulty computer and don't want to admit it. To make matter worse, the ethernet cable jack is very flimsy and the ethernet cable falls out very easily with the slightest resistance.Don't waste your money on this paperweight.
-	I've been waiting for this computer for months.I read that this was the fault-free incarnation of the UX31E, which in itself was absolutely great.So - I got my machine in the beginning on August 2012.From day one - non-stop problems.At first, problems with the Wi-Fi which kept disconnecting, or refusing to reconnect after sleeping.Than there was the gigantic mouse pad that no matter what I did kept interrupting me typing and throwing me from one end of the screen to the other.But you know what, I could live with all this if not for the keyboard breaking after 2 months of use. Some of the keys just stopped responding.Now I know, shit happens. Just go to the nearest Asus shop and they'll fix it, right? WRONG!!My machine has been lying in the shop for 1.5 months. They don't tell me when it'll be fixed. They don't respond at all to my online complaints and attempts to understand why it takes for a new machine 2 months to break and why ASUS can't fix it/replace it/refund it.Bottom line - I have a paper-weight that cost me 1,200 Euros with a manufacturer that refuses to take responsibility.Bottom line - stay away!!Even if your machine is ok, the service is non-existent. Be warned!!
-	this laptop arrived broken. it was dysfunctional and did not even turn on. and since i took the laptop to India, they refused to fix it there. i asked them to fix it coz it was damaged even before turning on, but they refused to fix it in India and asked to bring it back to USA.i then went to the Dell center, and surprisingly, they refused to do it to. i do get why dell wouldn't do it. i didnt have international warranty and i didnt even buy it from the dell store.be careful while buying from local vendors.
+	Apple MacBook Pro MC721LL/A 15.4" LED Notebook - Core i7 i7-2635QM 2 GHz is as good a notebook computer as one could asked for.  It is well constructed, highly functional, and require less fuss for all its functions.
+	Apart from esthetics and style this product possesses, it is a laptop that will last long and perform competently well.
-	Amazon edit staff, these comment were to appear for another model, this model is fine and I wish to remove this comment.
+	I have owned my new Macbook Pro for two months now.. I always had Dell  (four of them)  I find the Mac faster and it has much clearer grahics and lots of features which I am still learning.. I am very pleased with the purchase and recommend it if you can afford the extra money.
-	I'm not a computer person. I thought it would do what I wanted to do. Basic stuff. I can't even print pictures with my printer unless I pay for the Cloud. So if that info isn't given before you buy it you're screwed.
-	I have owned this computer three months and the screen jumps bad  would not recommend anyone buying this computer not worth it to have to send back to get fixed
-	My Sony E Series Vaio cost me a grand a year ago.  Overall its an OK laptop but the battery life is abysmal.  After a full charge It shuts off after three hours of use.  Don't reccomend.
+	Okay, I'm the first to admit that I'm not a computer person. I barely know anything about technology-only that I need it to survive. I had a Macbook for a couple of years that I bought from a friend and needed an upgrade. As this was the cheapest option available, I figured I'd go for it.And I'm so glad I did. It is incredibly user friendly. At the setup it asked if I had another Mac I wanted to use to load documents, etc, from and it gave me an option for methods of doing so. I ended up using my external hard drive for it. The computer remembered everything the way I had it on my other system-right down to the last detail. Setting it up took almost no time. I got the 500gb with 4gb of RAM and it runs so well. I am going to be upgrading it to 8g just because I want it to be even faster but from what I can tell it doesn't need it.The picture quality is incredible, I love that the keyboard is backlit, and the touchpad is so streamlined it actually makes it easier to use. I highly recommend this product whether you are a first time Mac user or a Mac lover from way back in the day. You won't be disappointed.*Note* I bought this product on Black Friday and received it two days ahead of schedule. Good job, Amazon. Excellent work.
+	About me: Network security analyst, hobbyist photographer, casual gamer.-----1 YEAR UPDATEAlthough I first reviewed this item Nov 2013 I owned it since Mar 2013. So far I've upgraded the hard drive to a Samsung Electronics 840 EVO-Series 500GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Single Unit Version Internal Solid State Drive MZ-7TE500BW. BOY IS IT FAST. Windows 8.1 is booting in about 5 seconds.I've also replaced the built-in Wifi with a Intel Network 6235AN.HMWWB Centrino WiFi Card Half Mini PCI Express Advanced-N 6235 Dual Band Bluetooth. There was nothing wrong with the Wifi it came with, but for ~$25 I gave my laptop Bluetooth 4.0 and dual band (2.4GHz and 5Ghz) Wifi for wireless-N speeds up to 300mbps. Upgrading it was as easy as upgrading my RAM to Crucial 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR3/DDR3L 1600 MHz (PC3-12800) CL11 SODIMM 204-Pin 1.35V/1.5V Memory for Mac CT2K8G3S160BM.I've found a way to get 5.5 hrs of battery life by turning down the max processor speed to 60% while on battery in the AMD Vision Control Center. Very nice!A year later this is still a great laptop!-----OVERVIEW1. SUMMARY2. DESIGN3. PERFORMANCE4. LIMITS1. SUMMARYThis is the section if you just want to hear the answer to your question: Should I buy it. Yes! There's not many other places you're going to get a quad-core processor, discrete-class graphics, a backlit keyboard and biometric sensor for less than $700. However if gaming is important to you, check out the "LIMITS" section below.2. DESIGNIt has an aluminum lid, palmrest/keyboard area and everything else is plastic. It is pretty light for a 15" laptop. It sports a full keyboard including the number pad "island", great for entering lots of numbers. I would've liked if the Num Lock key had an on/off indicator though. The keyboard is comfortable with keys spaced out enough not to have too many accidental strokes. You have to hold down the "fn" key to access f1 thru f12; they operate the various media/settings hotkeys by default (brightness, volume, music playback etc). This can be reversed in the BIOS/UEFI settings. If you are a gamer I recommend you do this. You don't want to disconnect your wifi by accidentally pressing the f12 key, which is near backspace and the volume control keys.The touchpad functions well and has a pleasant texture to it, but I feel the two buttons below it are an eyesore and could have been styled with more subtlety. Since it is multitouch, I never use the buttons. Hint: a two-finger tap is a right click.The charging/power on light by the charger port will flash amber when the battery is at 15%, whether the laptop is on or off. I like that.The speakers, covered by an aluminum plate with a pinhole pattern, can get stuff stuck in the small holes, taking away from the visual appeal of the laptop. Like any other computer, I don't recommend eating while using the machine or using it with dirty hands.3. PERFORMANCEThe AMD Vision chip is no joke. The quad-core A10 paired with the 7660G discrete-class graphics makes it great for photo editing, video editing and gaming. The AMD Vision Control Panel allows you to adjust for more battery life or more performance and supports profiles for when it's on battery and when it's charging that are more specific than Windows' power options. For example, I can set the maximum CPU frequency.The Radeon HD 7660G blows the Intel HD 4000 out of the water, period. This is better for gaming than any i7/HD 4000 laptop, period. NotebookCheck benchmarks report the 7660G is STILL better than the new Intel HD 5100 "Iris" line and is only slightly behind the Intel HD 5200 "Iris Pro" seen on the 2013 Retina Macbook Pros. It has 512MB dedicated DDR3 memory and up to 2GB shared memory. I have no problem doing Spot Healing large areas in Photoshop or juggling between various HD video clips in Adobe Premiere. It plays Skyrim on medium settings on 1366x768 resolution, and Diablo 3 on high settings with the same resolution, but it needs help when it comes to heat management. More on that in the LIMITS section.It has a snappy experience out of the box. I don't know whether to give credit to Windows 8 or the hardware for that; perhaps it's both. The laptop supports 16GB max RAM.The wireless card could be better. In certain spots in my home I have 3 bars of signal strength where my 2012 Macbook Pro has 5, even after installing the latest drivers. The wireless card is easy enough to upgrade if desired. Bluetooth is not included.I've gotten a consistent 4 hours battery life doing web browsing and word processing on wifi with brightness at 50% and keyboard backlight on. I've plugged it into a TV via HDMI and played a 2 hour movie, it still had about 40% battery life and an estimated 1h20min battery life remaining when the movie was over.4. LIMITSThis laptop has one flaw I can't ignore: poor heat management under serious gaming. Perhaps the 7660G is too powerful for the chassis but the fans simply can't keep up. If you're a gamer you're going to have to invest in a cooling pad. I'm happy with the Targus Lap Chill Mat. The laptop simply cannot get enough airflow/cooling for extended gaming without external assistance. I was overheating playing Diablo 3 after two hours (on max settings) with the laptop on a flat surface. Cooling pad or not, the bottom left corner of the laptop can get uncomfortably warm. I haven't found a solution for this aside from going in the AMD Vision Control Center and lowering the max CPU Power one notch to 86%. It still delivers excellent graphics performance despite the cap.All in all this computer is a great value and I would recommend purchasing. Just make sure to get a cooling pad if gaming is important.
+	The Mac Book Pro 13" is a perfect Laptop if you want use it for your home.  If you are willing to make a lot of Foto and video editing, you should buy more RAM memory, up to 8 or 16 GB.
+	Packaging:Very impressed with the packaging. I was very impressed how well this thing was packaged. A well thought-out design protects the content and minimizes customer dissatisfaction.First impression:I am sure everyone who are interested to buy this product, has gone to best buy and played with it a bit. well, the new MBP right out of the box is 90% more impressive and attractive than that of the store. It is a good looking piece of machine.It came with a charger, extension cord for the charger, instruction book, screen wipe, and nothing more that I needed. I took the cord out, and started charging it. A full charging is highly recommended before use. after a few setup screens, I am up and running.Upgrade time:(Make sure you shut down your machine first)I ordered this machine with a 8GB memory upgrade (DDR3-1333) from Crucial. I did not want to pay a premium for the apple upgrade. Instead, I bought a dual channel kit separately for $39.00. I highly recommended Crucial brand as they use Samsung memory chips and for one more reason I am telling you next. I will not go through how to change the memory(a lot of youtube videos available). when I took out the existing memory out of the MBP, guess what chips they use on the memory sticks? yes, guessed it right, samsung.And I also have reasons to believe that the RAMs are OEM version of crucial memory judging by physical similarities. but, that is just my opinion, not a fact.User Experience:After the upgrade, turned on the machine and few beeps and clunks later, it started flying. I repeat, it is flying and my machine is currently running over 600 threads without any sign of slowing down. virtual box? NO PROBLEMO! this little beauty is a little beast in performance. I have installed over 50 applications, running dozens simultaneously, 10 more browser windows open, and it just happy. I can't say enough about the multi-touch gestures. No other laptop I have ever used that had such ease of switching between applications, scrolling, searching, sliding  and navigating. I have never used Mac OS before(not more than a few minutes of playing around at best buy), and I felt it was very intuitive to use and learned fairly quickly. I still don't know a lot about the OS, but it has not stopped me from doing what I need to do.What could be better:Not that I cared much, but the standard power cord is a little short. I bought a sleeve to keep it safe, and it does not allow room for the extension cord that comes with it(big and bulky).It has good speakers that play nice sounding beats. But the 15" plays them better.The outer shell is aluminium, but don't think you can't scratch it. I spent a sleepless night just cause it put a small scratch under it by accident. But, I am over it now.Advice to the people who wants to take the plunge:I felt like it was the best $1100 I spent on a laptop. I could not justify it before using it as I always thought that Mac is more style than performance and usefulness. I admit that I was wrong. This machine offers more features and performance per dollar than I thought. This is a well-built machine that would serve me longer than any other laptop ever has for me. I have half a dozen windows machines in my house including a 990X extreme desktop that I built 4 months ago. I love windows, but I have learned that I can like both (Macbook pro and PC).
-	I purchased this Laptop for my brother in law. My bad i never returned the laptop or raised any complaint with in 30days of purchase as it started crashing often, over heated and finally when i send it to the HP service center they tell that this laptop cannot be servcied as this Motherboard chips are burned due to moisture content. They returned my laptop not serviced as it does not covers under the warrenty. Wrost service from HP AMS TCO Escalations Team aand they ask me to pay for the service even though it is still under warrenty period. For this I dont want to pay half the price of the laptop for service.
+	I received item (laptop) in good condition, quick ship, nice parking, and working fine without problem, best regard and thanks
-	This was the worst lap top i had in my life,very bad customer serviceI lost my money on this laptop, and now i regret it.I am not gonna buy any Sony products in the future.
+	The only drawback I have with it so far is the weak speakers but I did not necessarily buy it for the speakers much more the functionality of a laptop.  I also dislike how the swiping method from outside the mousepad onto the mousepad alternates open windows but I am sure I can edit that once I figure out more of the operating system.Seller experience:  It was a bit confusing due to the fact that the seller sells products on both Amazon and Ebay.  I wanted two of these units however one sold on eBay during my purchase of two.  I had great feedback from the seller and we cancelled the order and I just had to reorder the one he had left.  It was tedious but at least he is up front and honest.
+	Having received an iPad 2 for my birthday in September, and feeling that the world was going to end if I didn't update my 3 year old Windows laptop, I decided to give the Mac a try. I am definitely not tech savvy but can pick up things fairly quickly despite my advancing years, however I have to say that initially I had my reservations and seriously felt I had made a mistake. I stuck with it however and have gradually come to enjoy the machine.The most outstanding feature in my mind is the Trackpad that everyone pretty much swoons about. It is amazing. When one gets used to the gestures and ability to click anywhere on the pad with either one finger or two, it just comes to life. Having more money, or rather, more credit, than sense, I married the Mac to both the Apple BT keyboard and trackpad, which makes my office setup both ergonomic and fun.I am still plodding away learning Lion OS which is a departure from Windows 7 and I have to say I do not find it that intuitive, however it is slowly making more sense to me.I decided to upgrade my RAM which, according to Crucial Memory, the Pro will in fact support 16GB as opposed to the 8GB proclaimed by Apple and look forward to installing it today and seeing whether it speeds up my machine. I have to say I am not a heavy multi-tasker with computers or life in general, but it will be interesting to see any changes.Another small frustration in getting to know the mac, and an indicator to my poor pre purchase research, is that some software designed for the mac is different that it's Windows counterparts. Not a huge thing however I enjoyed some aspects of Quicken for Windows not available on the mac version. Hence the wallet opened again and after installing Parallels for Mac and a new copy of Windows 7, I now have the ability to run Windows products seamlessly with my Mac OS all the while continuing to delight in the benefits of the touchpad on the Mac giving me the best of both worlds.All in all I am very happy with the machine and do not regret the purchase. Speed wise it seems good enough for all that I need as I am not a gamer, huge multi-tasker or graphic heavy user. The experience does continue and whereas I was very happy with Windows 7 and Microsoft in general, I am starting to lean more towards Apple. Only time will tell.......Small addendum:Upon upgrading the RAM two things came to light as suggestions. Firstly, invest in a correctly sized mini "phillips style" screwdriver with a good sized handle. The 10 or so screws are fairly securely fastened requiring a moderate amount of torque to get them going. A slightly larger than optimum screw head could easily strip the screw making removal of the back plate a major bug bear.Secondly, if you are, like me, upgrading to different capacity memory sticks, put the larger of the banks in the bottom memory bay. I initially installed my new 8GB module in the top bay, leaving the original 2GB module in the bottom bay. Unfortunately the Mac did not recognize the new module and maintained the original 2GB, 2GB configuration. After a brief review of the Crucial website, I found the suggestion to try and reverse the order of the modules which I did resulting in the Mac recognizing all 10GB when "About this Mac" was consulted.
-	I've had this computer for 2 years and some months (got it in November of 2008). It's been a headache. The hinges broke fairly quickly, the battery stopped charging, it crashes often, it becomes extremely hot to where it burns skin if it touches it, the screen if coming apart, and the mouse pad doesn't seem to work well. I asked dell for help after realizing that this was occurring with numerous inspiron 1525 laptops and they pretty much gave me the finger. This is the only purchase I have ever regretted. Don't buy a dell. As a matter of fact, don't even accept it as a gift.
+	This Laptop is just amazing! It is very portable and durable. But, as with most products, there has to be some cons. The display has a glossy finish and dust and other things stick to it. Because of that, you need to wipe off the screen often. Another con, is that if you use this computer while it's charging, it will start to "shock" you. It will be quite annoying, but it stops once you pull out the charger from the computer. Overall this computer is great if you know how to use it, and if you're careful with it.PROS:1- Great Keyboard2-Looks Awesome3-Great Battery Life4-Nice sound Quality5- VERY FASTCONS:1- Computer shocks you when it's charging (and in use at the same time)2-Sticky display3- Screen is very vulnerable to scratches4-Keys can pop off easily
-	One week after the warranty expired, the motherboard and dc adapter failed.  Repairs will cost $1000.My husband bought the same laptop.  It's been in for repairs twice, including a new motherboard.  Thankfully his repairs were covered by warranty.We will never buy ASUS again.
-	I bought one of these 'devices' from a Best Buy because another laptop required repair and I needed it to use a computer immediately for travel.  I will say that Toshiba will not receive business from me again, although it takes two to tango.  In this case, the partner is Windows Vista.If you are a generic user that doesn't need to use the laptop for major use, it may not be that bad.  If you are someone like me who will simultaneously have AutoCAD, Excel, and other software open, don't waste your time.  If I could find the decision makers for this laptop and the fine Microsoft persons who gave the green light to Vista, I would skin them alive and then dip them in vinegar to make up for one tenth of the frustration I've had with this computer.When I restart, the computer has always gone into an endless boot where it looks to start with the hard drive, then goes to the DVD play... and back... and forth... and back... and forth... Enough said there.  The laptop is massively overpowered by that dirty diaper full of programming called Vista.  It is a 64 bit version, so realize when you buy it that A LOT OF YOUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WON'T BE ABLE TO RUN ON 64 bit Vista.  As a result of this purchase (here, we step into the Vista diaper deeper), I had to purchase a new printer, a new version of AutoCAD, a new version of Norton Ghost (which eventually won't run anyways), a new portable scanner... and the list goes on and on. My fine new $800 laptop cost me an extra several thousand dollars to run with modified soft/hardware.  You would think that Toshiba would have been prepared for this kind of problem.  Eventually, I paid a kid to swipe the toilet clean ... I mean the laptop, and replace it with Windows 7.  While this does seem to have solved some problems, the laptop is still underpowered.And Toshiba, thanks for putting a Labelflash drive in it.  Unfortunately, although it does a great job, companies like Toshiba never supported it as well as it should have been supported and Labelflash has turned this into the Beta (of VHS versus Beta fame) when compared to Lightscribe.  Again, I like Labelflash BETTER than Lightscribe, so don't get me wrong about that.  It's just that Labelflash is going bye-bye.  BEWARE - Finding Labelflash DVDs is getting tougher and will get expensive.  It does a great job, but the market has collapsed for them...Maybe I got a lemon?  I can't say for sure, but I can say that Toshiba should be ashamed of putting out such a piece of junk.  Microsoft should be ashamed... well, for the last 10 years of garbage they've put out.  I hope you have better luck than I did if you get this 'device'.Skip this machine and look elsewhere and make sure that you never buy a laptop/computer with a dirty diaper (Vista) installed.-M-PS - Strong letter to follow.
+	This was my first Mac, and I don't know why it took me so long to get one.  It has changed the way I work, and I don't think I will ever g back to a windows-based system.
-	This laptop is good but it isn't great, the pointing stick is really sensitive, and the keyboard is really easy to adjust to, but it is very easy to leave fingerprints on the cover; nonetheless, this is good machine.The US version comes with the Intel Atom 1.33GHz, but the Japanese version as well as the ones in Hong Kong come with the option of choosing Intel Z520 1.33GHz, Z530 1.6GHz, and Z540 1.86GHz. Once again the US isn't getting the "right" stuff, for some reason US will also have this lag in presenting us the product we wanted. I also asked one of the sales representative, and he says there will be an upgraded version in US, but it's going to take awhile, so don't waste your money now and wait for the upgrades or you could choose to buy the Japanese version, which is available in many websites.
-	I normally love macs but this one had to be fixed only a week after owning it. I am still waiting to hear the verdict on whether it can be fixed or not. I guess this is what you get for a few hundred dollars. I do have to say the seller did ship fast.
+	I have been very hesitant to purchase a refurbished laptop.  I did not want to spend a lot of money.  I did my research and I bought this laptop at the best price I could find plus it is in great condition just like the seller described.  I received it within a few days and I am very happy with it.  Thank you!
-	I intended to find a laptop with WIndows 7 to avoid the hassles of Windows 8; however, I thought with a touchscreen, Windows 8 might not be too bad. So, in my search I came across this computer with this sentence within the description:"Enjoy the ability to pinch, swipe, rotate or scroll through images on the display screen with a simple brush of your fingers."Due to the wording of this statement I mistakenly assumed this was a touchscreen. It is not. This statement is about the touchpad, not the screen itself.While there is nothing wrong with this laptop per se, I would not have purchased it had the description been more clear that this is not a touchscreen. I would have looked for another laptop either with Windows 7 or a touchscreen.12/8/13: Update: I have had this a few days and am still trying to get all the Windows 8 updates downloaded to get to Windows 8.1 (so far at 96). At this point, I am strongly considering wiping it and loading my old version of Vista.I also just discovered NO HDMI PORT! I can't believe a new laptop would be sold without HDMI!
+	Product arrived in good condition and on time.  The new macbook is all it promised to be - really pleased with the product.
+	Once we got past the frustration of not knowing how to do anything, this laptop has worked great for us.  It's super easy to transfer all your existing files to the new laptop... however, it wasn't so easy for us to find the files!  We finally figured out they were under a different User ID / Login.  This totally could have been user error as we had no idea what we were doing.  It's very fast and sleek.
-	Pros:  I don't know yet because I can't get past the wifi issues.Cons:  A laptop without wifi is a horrible desktop and since you need a dongle with this laptop that doesn't come with it, then that makes this laptop a really expensive paper weight.I have tried everything in the forums as well as in other reviews here and mine still won't connect.  I contacted Acer and they had me do a recover WITHOUT telling me that it would create a new install and put everything in the Windows.OLD folder, so now I get to redownload MS Office 2013 while tethered to my cell phone.  What a piece of junk.  I think this one is going back.  I'd rather spend an extra $20 for a Dell that will connect out of the box.
-	I might be wrong but I did/tried to order which had Nvidia graphics card but got a laptop with only Intel graphics card.
-	HP needs to be banned by Amazon and from the American Market.HP is selling bad Chinese made laptops in the US and on Amazon.The laptops will appear nice once you buy but after a short while of usage, they will go south and you will no choice but to send them with a good faith for repair. Unless you're still in warranty, kiss this bad HP goodbye.This is how they get the poor American consumer by selling a short life product and profiting over us buying extended warranty over and over on a defective Chinese HPs.Save Us Amazon from this evil and monstrous company that is mis-managed overseas and abusing the American Consumers thru bad manufacturary and unfair plots for profits.
-	I have owned my fair share of Sony products over the years however, I caution you on buying this newer Ultrabook especially from ePark.  I purchased this Ultrabook for my father this past Christmas.  I bought it on cyber Monday and bought that I got a pretty good deal.  It is now March and it already does not work.  My dad dropped it off at my house I ran diagnostics on it.  I figured out that the OS seems corrupted.So, I contacted ePark: I opened a return through amazon and a couple days later I get a one lined e-mail that reads.  YOUR OUT SIDE YOUR WARRANTY WINDOW status: CLOSED. That's it!Okay?!  I called square trade.  Now, my hats off to these guys!  They were efficient and answered all my questions.  However, they told me that the Ultrabook is still under manufactures warranty. GREAT, I think I will use the free warranty!  They give me the phone number to customer support.Now... The "new and improved" Sony support center.  Support should first of all be taken out of the name.  I first talk with tech support.  Okay, I will run through your test to make sure that my Ultrabook is indeed broken.  Awesome, [sony support] you also, think my computer is broken.  No, problem transfers me to the next person.  Now, I did not expect what was coming next.  "Okay, Eric"  she says  "I see that your Ultrabook has a corrupted file on it and you need the restore software.  That will be $149.99'!!"This did not go over very well...  They wanted to charge me for a recovery disc and buy an external cd/dvd drive because it is an Ultrabook and does not have one.  I told her that I am not doing that.  Anyway finally got the disc for $6 and even got them to pay for shipping.  It only took two and a half hours and some reasoning.  Picked up an external off newegg with a rebate for $24.99.  So, for $31.00 I should be able to get my Dad's computer fixed.  I would have spent that sending it in with insurance and what not but I guess it will do.It does seem like a good computer and I do see that the OS is more Microsoft than Sony but that was a bit ridiculous, but in my opinion do not buy from ePark or this model.  There are much better ones that are not too much more.
-	Bought this for my husband who refused a Dell due to problems with customer support in the past.  Well, newsflash!  Lenovo is a piece of junk and you can't even reach customer service in their convoluted phone system.  Next time... stick with the Dell. This Lenovo is slooooooow to start and it's diagnostics says it is working in tip top performance.  Really?  I don't think 3 mins start up is tip top!  The mouse sticks constantly.  You have to hit the keyboard with force to move it!  Very very very disappointed in my purchase.
+	The computer works just fine.  It's solid, fast, good battery, attractive and light.  I didn't know if I would like Ubuntu but wanted a simpler, faster OS.  When I first loaded the OS and began to use it, it seemed slow.  Then I let the system update itself online.  This turns out to be absolutely essential and should not be postponed.  Once all the (200 and something) updates were complete and I rebooted, everything worked as it should.  Programs launch fast, wireless internet connects promptly, etc.The open-source versions of MS Office work very much, but not exactly, like MS Office.  I find that I can take my files from Windows and edit them on this computer with little problem.  Those files go back to my Windows desktop and work fine using MS Office.
-	Opened box and followed instructions exactly, plugged in power supply before turning on. I bought this computer to replace an old Dell Vostro 1510 running Windows Vista because it was slow and isn't compatable with the newest versions of explorer and chrome. Well this new Acer with Windows 8.1 is even slower. Will spend a few days trying to solve some of the issues and then will probably try and sell it on e-bay.
+	It's already Lion install in it, like it much! But I think 4G memory is a little bit small for Xcode. When I compile an OGRE project, it will run out of memory sometimes.
-	Got mine a week ago. The touch screen is buggy  and very unreliable and requires restarts. I bought the system for speed, ITs VERY slow! Constantly having to reboot, ect., ect. It pisses me off I feel the need to spend the time to warn others. Don't buy it!! Mines headed to the dump! POC I'm going back to Dell!
-	I bought this laptop from Best Buy on February 6, 2010, shortly after it came out.  I have had nothing but problems with it and with Sony's technical support (technicians).  First, the technicians had no idea the laptop existed.  The day I bought the machine, I called to verify my warranty and three technicians at Sony told me I had only a one year warranty - it does actually have two years, and I think Sony finally knows this. The speakers have a terrible intermittent buzzing noise that is not helped by the driver update offered from Sony.  When questioning the difference between the software Vaio Messenger and Vaio Update, the Sony technician actually told me that Vaio Messenger was a bag, like a messenger bag.  The keyboard started squeaking 4 days after I bought it.  The touchpad is even defective.  Often the right click menu will pop-up without me clicking the right-click button.  Also the mouse jumps from one part of the screen to another.As far as the specs go, they look great on paper, but aren't any faster than a Core 2 Duo 2.1 GHz.  The automatic backlight on the keyboard only comes up for a few seconds before it goes out.  Firefox and Office 2003 will often stop responding.Sony technical support is terrible and I've often received conflicting information, sometimes from the same technician.  They have no idea that the Automatic Screen Brightness exists.  Every phone call I've made has been at least 30 minutes long and most are over an hour.  On March 24th I was offered on-site technical service.  Today is April 20th and I'm still waiting.  No one at Sony has even said "I'm sorry you're experiencing these problems."  Best Buy has offered to exchange the machine today and I am doing just that.You would do well to spend your money on a machine that works, isn't as expensive as this one, and with a company that actually cares about their consumer.
-	I purchased my Macbook Pro in May 2012 after deliberating on whether to purchase a different brand of laptop after being let down by my Acer laptop. After doing some research and reading reviews I finally decided on the MacBook Pro MD313. My first concern was about the 2 USB ports. With so many devices to connect I thought that these wouldn’t be sufficient for my needs, but then I compromised. I have not had any problems with the machine thus far until about 2 weeks ago. When I connect my devices they disconnect within 5 seconds. I then started having to work on documents on drop box as I couldn’t save anything. After doing research on the internet I find out that there is a possibility that I may need the logic board replaced. I then took the machine to the istore so they could send it to the technicians. The technicians say my USB ports are damaged and since they are attached to the logic board the entire thing needs to be replaced. The cost of replacing it, close to $ 700. That’s almost the price of a new MacBook Pro. To say the least I am disappointed that a machine of this calibre can have problems like this. I have memory sticks which can’t be inserted incorrectly as connectors are only on the top part of the usb stick. I back my laptop up once every 2 months to a sea gate external drive. I can’t believe that a laptop which costs so much can be so useless. I have never had a similar problem with any of my laptops. Here I was thinking I would keep this Mac for the next 5 years as many people has said theirs lasted a long time. I am now stuck with a piece of apple junk that cost me $ 1100. If someone sees me with another apple product they must just shoot me.
+	I had MacBook Pro since 2009 and my daughter always try to use it instead of her HP laptop of same age.She said that it is more fast and not freeses at all. So for Christmas I bought for her Mac Book Pro new version and she is so happy with it.Very important I dont have to renew every year McAfee protection plan for PC. It seems that Apple laptop not affected by viruses as PC.
+	Bottom line, if you want to develop phone / tablet apps, this is a great computer for it.Specs were for programming Visual Studio 2012 and Eclipse Juno (and occasionally Force.com IDE / Salesforce.com and WordPress).  I also occasionally use Adobe CS suite and Microsoft SQL Server for developers 2012 as well as The VS tools and Office 2013...Intel i7 CPU @ 2.9016 GB ramWindows 8 64 bit (upgraded from Windows 7)Hard Disk: 500 gig no SSDDocking stationWhy Selected:I selected it because it seemed the best/ easiest way to write mobile apps and easily debug in using the virtual hardware, touch screen - and it is GREAT for this.What's Wrong:First- the computer was incomplete out of the box, Wi-Fi did not work and camera did not work.  Two visits from support and this was fixed.  I have come to expect this from many vendors, not just computer vendors. So no stars taken.  Initially talking with Lenovo, support was REALLY BAD. I expected "Business Customer" support not "Consumer Level"Summary:As a software development machine, it's perfect, fast, and easy to test touch screen capabilities of virtual phones.  With the docking station I can attach 6 phones and tablets for easy testing and debugging.I don't use the touchpad, I had significant problems with my laser mouse, but found the right driver (system could not determine the correct driver) and solved the problem.The tools with Lenovo to maintain updates is very easy to use and I appreciate it,  I had to download all the Windows 8 updates, took a long time (why no single package I don't know), most functionality is supported in Windows 8, I had low expectations, so was pleasantly surprised. The utilities of Lenovo are really nice, I don't worry about maintaining my environment.What I miss:I wish it had a great on board video card (I knew it did not) because I would like to drive multiple IPS 27 inch monitors and play the occasional leading edge computer game.  Games, I have another machine, multiple 27 inch monitors, there is no work around.
+	Went from Windows XP to Windows 8 on the new lap top. The computer works great. Still need to figure out how to get the mouse to scroll down when I swipe down, instead of the opposite. I am right handed and having the mouse biased to the left side of the key board is a big pain in the rear. I am constantly activating the start screen.
-	Its been 6 months now since my husband brought one. There are many things I dislike in this laptop1. The keys are flimsy and started coming out in just a few months. 2 keys are totally damaged (including spacebar :( )since they don't even latch in place.2.  Battery stays on for just 30 mins3. Ever since we owned it, we are having difficulty with the touch pad. I have tried various settings but either they react especially while typing, or they don't react at all.4. Ours have windows 8 and its a steep learning curve because of all the nuances. Sidebars and full screen opened apps keep popping up while using touch pad.Its too inconvenient
+	This laptop is awesome but you should know that Apple gives the rights to software such as iLife to the original owner and the Apple ID of any owners after, will not be able to easily access and update those apps.  When I purchased this puter the original owner was able to use a remote access program to reinstall those apps with his Apple ID, so I could use it, but I will not be able to receive future updates.  The Mac App store wouldn't even let me purchase iLife Apps, due to the previous owner already installing those apps for my puters particular s/n.
-	As with many other reviews I've seen, shortly after the warranty expired my computer suddenly wouldn't turn on, with no warning whatsoever. Upon start up it just gave me a black screen and some loud beeps. I learned that this was a problem with the motherboard, and replacing it out of pocket was too costly for me, so now it's useless. For what it's worth, I almost chose to give more stars than one because the actual functionality of the computer was great before the motherboard randomly went out, but for me that's not enough to justify forking out more cash later on, and more importantly, losing everything on my hard drive. This computer was sold at a great price (I bought it in store for about 400, not sure why it's so much here), but I suggest you save yourself the trouble and spend a little extra now on something that will last, as I wish I had done!EDIT: Tons and tons of people with the exact same situation (motherboard fail after 15 months or less) on the Dell community message boards, and still no official word from Dell on the problem. Obviously this is an error on their part, hopefully they will recall this model. I'd love to hear back after 15 months of use from anyone giving a 5 star review just a few weeks after purchase, I'm almost positive you'll be singing a different tune.
+	Excellent product of HP.  Very easy to operate in Windows 8 and very fast too.  The silver color is very good.
-	This computer would have been 5 stars except for one fatal flaw. The wifi card is terrible. Let me repeat that: THE WIFI CARD IS TERRIBLE. If you don't mind regressing backwards a few years to the days when you'd have to wait and wait for websites to load, then you will love this computer. For everyone else you will find it completely unacceptable. I actually purchased a separate wifi card to use with this computer, cause sometimes you know, I actually like to use the internet.Sure the card is rated at wireless n speeds, and sure my network monitor claims to have perfect signal and 65mbps connection, but actual use tells a different story. If I monitor the signal strength in db it will appear normal displaying a normal and acceptable signal, then will jump to -200db (very very bad) for a second and go back down - and it does this constantly!Speed test also confirms extremely unreliable wifi connectivity. But don't just take my word for it, buy this computer and then you too will know what a pos it is. Which pains me to say because its otherwise great and I used to think HP built quality computers (perhaps they did at one point in time, not anymore). Would not recommend. Would  not even smash to bits with 10ft pole.
+	Probably the best computer I will ever haveIt's fast and runs perfectShipping was very fast and computer quality was great..Wanted to upgrade to OSX 10.8.3 but I read to many negative reviews ill just wait for a more stable releaseSo far 10.7.5 is running greatWill recommend to other ppl I know
-	This laptop is too hard to use because of Windows 8.  If you have the ability to reformat it and install Windows 7, then it's a good deal.  HP laptops are good quality, and their customer service is top notch
+	i bought this little laptop for my 11 year old daughter:pros:- the size and weight are perfect for her- the keyboard and the trackpad are surprisingly good and easy to use (even for me)- the cpu, ram and hard disk are enough for playing minecraft, open a word doc and web browsing at the same time.- the screen is bright and clear, not too reflective- it arrived with ubuntu os but i replaced it with windows 8 pro and has been working flawlessly for 4-5 weeks so farcons:- i haven't tested it with a clock but the battery life and the time it takes full charge again are not what they should- the heat at the exhaust of  the proccessor, if you place it in your lap wearing shorts is more annoying than serious, anywaysaccessories you might consider:- in regard of the point before, Opteka X-Stand Ergonomic Portable Natural Airflow Cooling Stand For all 12-17" Laptop / Notebook Computers for extra peace of mind and improving the line of view- Case Logic QNS-111 11.6-Inch EVA Molded Netbook Sleeve (Black) for carrying and caring it, have just the right size for the laptop plus power cord/charger.originally i was considering the touchscreen version but i'm very happy with this purchase, add it to the low price tag and for me is 100% recommended
+	Replacement for my old HP that finally stopped working; couldn't be more pleased! I've recommended this to my associates as they are looking for a replacement as well.
-	I wish I sent it back.  My internet is high speed and home computer even though it is old is still way faster then this, also freezes often when downloading files, small ones , big ones size does not matter in this case.  Very disappointed.  Wasted my money and I try not to use it much because it is very frustrating.
+	I've always wanted to dive into the world of Mac. I'm impressed with the quality of the product. Very intuitive and innovative in design and operation. I've been a PC guy for many years. Now I'm excited about transitioning to Mac. The thing I think is very useful is the mousepad and how different touching techniques execute so many different commands that help tremendously with workflow. All around it's very well built and thought out. Highly recommended!!!
+	I love everything about this MacBook Pro.  The 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 is fast to me!  I upgraded to 8 GB of RAM, which I completely recommend and it's very cheap).  It's portable enough to take from office to home and travel; it's slim and light.  It's powerful and even more powerful than my current desktop (a fairly new Macbook) and the batter life is wonderful!  While I could use a bigger screen when I'm working on multiple documents, I compromised space for portability and I don't regret it.  The Thunderbolt works great with the HDMI adapter (just remember to change the sound settings in System Preferences and choose your TV as your sound output device).  Though it works great, before the first year is up, I plan to purchase Apple Care to extend the warranty two more years...you never know and I've been very happy with Apple Care for previous computers.  I didn't purchase it right away to save a little money upfront.
-	It's beautiful to look at and light as a feather to carry around, but it's been nothing but trouble.Had to return it to ASUS within 30 days to rebalance keyboard that kept going out of control of its own accord.Then the hard drive crashed and had to send it back again.Now the thing won't power up, even when plugged into AC adaptor (which shows green indicator lights, so appears to be working.)DON'T BE TEMPTED BY ITS PRETTINESS - this thing is UGLY where it counts!!!!!
-	Purchased this item from Amazon 6 months ago. Its had 3 warranty related hardware problems. I'd like to personally thank Tim Cook and his brilliant Supply Chain Management skills for the defective components. I brought the computer into the Apple Millenia Store in Orlando, Fl. for evaluation and repair by the Not-So-Genius Amnesiac Bar on December 31, 2011. Two weeks later the computer is still sitting there. Nobody has a status on anything. The computer was possibly hacked and compromised while in Apple's possession.The Apple Store is impossible to communicate with, they seem to refuse to communicate with the BBB as well, where I've filed a complaint. Its like the Chris Nolan movie Memento where the main character completely loses his memory every 15 minutes. At the Apple Store it's every 10 nanoseconds.All in all, a terrible experience. If Windows 8 is even 70% as good as it looks, this Lemon will be in the trash where it belongs. Either way, I will never buy another Apple product again.
-	Actually I would really give it less than 1 Star.In my experience, with this computer you will need to replace the battery after 6 months or less even with LIGHT use (at the cost of $175 through Dell). Secondly, your 'Laptop' will end up becoming a 'Desktop' because the screen will quit working and you will have to borrow your screen from your desktop (unless you want to pay the $200+ to repair or replace the screen).  Thirdly, you will find out that your Desktop screen will not keep a signal  because there are no screw-in options on the side where the connection for the extra screen is.  All of this will thenleave you with the the following options: a)replace the screen b)repair the screen if it is possible to repair or c)buy the replacement part that has the screws on it so your desktop screen will keep a signal.And if that isn't enough to turn you off, no worries, because it gets worse...After all of the above, out of the clear blue sky, your hard drive will take a dive & then all you will be left with is deciding which day to take it out to the trash.To give you an idea of how common my story is with this brand, here's some searches you can Google:1) Dell Inspiron+screen black2) Dell Inspiron+screen won't come3) Dell Inspiron+battery not charging4) Dell Inspiron+won't boot upBottom Line: Unless you are looking for a way to give yourself a migraine, I would highly recommend that you steer clear of this brand altogether.
-	As a tech, I see a lot of computers, and very rarely do I see one so bad I must publicly shame it.  HP has been doing their best for years to taunt me into shaming them publicly, but until the G6 I have kept it under my hat.  Three of these have come in brand new with a host of issues, from sound not working, to freezing, to just failing entirely.  One of them we bought from the customer as part of a trade fora better computer; I figured I could use it as a rental for the shop.  I figured wrong, the first time it went out the door as a rental (with a brand new hard drive and OS reload) it stopped working within an hour or so.Stay away from this model, and HP in general until they get their crap together.On the brighter side, HP warranty service is very good, but that will not help you much with one of these computers.
+	my fourth Macbook Pro and i couldn't be happier.  upgrading from the 3.06 Duo to the 2.3 i7 makes things at LEAST twice as fast.  go for the anti-glare screen, trust me!
-	Now that I use it, I hate it.Many things I hate. The worst is that the PC cannot output HD audio via HDMI?! thats crazy. It can output only stereo signals and not any uncompressed digital signals. The Intel Atom documentation says that it is supposed to. Samsung has got it wrong here somewhere.The Keyboard will never ever stay connected to the tablet. Terrible connectivity issues. My recommendation - DO NOT BUY. Samsung customer service is absolutely helpless. I am being bounced back and forth. Their warranty only covers for service - and not for replacement or refund. Buyer beware before buying laptops that have inherent deficiencies such as this.-----I haven't tried a lot, but here is my initial comment - It looks good, but a bit bulky on hand. The Pen is a bit of a hype, doesn't write fast. The keyboard falls off for some reason if you lift the screen. Also the tablet doesn't pop out from the dock unless placed on a surface?! I am not sure though.I liked the OS, its speed. I am not sure if it is going to support a USB internet device. If it does, that will be great.The updates took a long while, and weren't very intuitive. I felt a bit of warmth on the back of the tablet, unlike my other tablets - asus transformer which is absolutely cool operating.I haven't tried the camera, or working with a lot of apps yet.
-	I've had my Asus G73JW ROG-A1B5N since February 2011.  Since then I've had to have it serviced once because of a cracked display, for which I have no idea how that happened.  That cost $600.00+.  Now the display won't work at all, even plugging in a secondary display won't work, and now the machine won't even come on.  Lesson learned, do not buy Asus, and if you do, don't buy a machine without a warranty.  This is the first time I've ever had any issue with a lap top and I can't believe I've problems twice on the same machine.
+	I like the computer. it is my first MAC and i managed to do a back up and set up my passwords... I am still in the transition face.  I think  for that money i would much rather now got me a gaming laptop (PC)
-	I love this computer.. was so fast and pretty. All the materials were great, and the aluminium cover felt very nice. I could ran programs as SolidWorks, Matlab and Autocad by the same time. But the computer arrived with a screen issue. The screen started failing after 2 weeks of use, and after that a vertical line on pixels was dead. I knew intermediately that this was a factory issue so i returned it to be repair but i received a refund. 2 months later i don't have the computer, and now i have to buy another again.Edit: i bought another envy dv6 laptop and guess what???? same screen issues!!!!!! Worst PC screen design ever. Thanks God amazon refunded me my money i i built my own computer. HP, never again.
-	As the title says, no good. Baught this on black friday and got it not long afterwards, after a week of working decently it starts crashing with a "no bootable device" error, which sounds to me like a hard drive issue. I am sending it back post haste.
-	This laptop, with the Microsoft operating system is awful!!!!  Pictures wont download, printer wont install, the screens flash on and off. Always restarts. Errors... Very upset, wish I could return it, but it is too late.
-	My wife bought a green one because she liked the color and style.  Yes, it is stylish and lightweight, and easy to carry (fits perfectly into her favorite handbag!).  But every time I use it, I get so frustrated with its slow speed that I want to just toss this thing out the window.  Apparently there is no system malfunction, applications are kept to minimal, and the power-saving mode is set to high performance (at the expense of battery hours), but it is still too slow.  Small notebooks coming out of Taiwan in recent years cost less than 1/2 of this unit, and they are more than twice as fast.  If you are looking to make a fashion statement, then go for this Vaio.  If you are after a lightweight notebook that is practical and functional, then stay away.
+	Well it's a Mac and it wasn't cheap. Got it as a gift for my now ex. Great fit and finish. Great support. Get what you pay for.
+	Flawless product.  Apple makes great quality products.  You get what you pay for.  Wish it came with a system DVD though considering Apple has so much money.
+	i cant believe ive never purchased an apple computer before .. im officially a mac lover, i still love pc but i just love the simplicity of this os.i was a little skeptical about the price, i just kept thinking to myself is this computer really worth the price ... i could literally buy two PC's for the price of the base line model macbook pro. BUT i bought the macbook pro 13 inch and I AM GLAD I DID. i just love it and i've only had it for 2 hours lol as im writing this review. I also purchased 8 gb ram for it already, and this computer is just running flawlessly running adobe programs and final cut pro
+	This product is Absolutely Fabulous! I am from Russian Federation and ordered this device when was in NY.Notebook was shiped and received during 4 days as agreed.Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit was preinstalled instead windows 7 home premium.Using it for a week and there are no any regrets!Strongly recommended for purchasing.
-	This is a lovely computer that I received early September 2012. Except for the critical fact that after 2 weeks, some of the keyboard keys are intermittently failing to register: the C, the K, the Q, and the space bar. I emailed Asus support about 12 hours ago so hopefully I'll hear back from them soon. Why ruin a lovely computer with such a basic failing?!?! I want to keep this computer, but cannot if this continues. (Yes, for some reason the keys are working now as I type this, but they often weren't working for the previous 2 days.)
-	When plugged in, the ASUS G750 laptops are great. However, when on battery power they are considerably slower. It turns out that ASUS has throttled the CPU and GPU when the G750 series is on battery power in order to inflate their battery life numbers. Plugged in, the CPU runs at 3.3 GHz (Task Manager - Performance tab). Pull the plug and go on battery and the CPU drops to .77 GHz (approx 25%). ASUS did this knowingly as they have a BIOS UPDATE (#208) to fix this problem but the fix doesn't work. Customer support is of no use as they didn't know (or admit to knowing) about the throttling or the BIOS update 208 to supposedly fix it. If you want a laptop to use plugged in on your desk, this is great. If, like me, you need a powerful laptop to use in the field, you'd be better off with a pentium III
-	Got it from AMAZON WAREHOUSE DEALS and the logic board is messed up and I have it repairing at my local apple shop. Very disappointed that this is supposed to be tested and functional like what is says on the unit but obviously it really was not. So buyers be aware you may get a defective unit and if you want to save a few bucks but maybe have to go thru the hassle of fixing it because it is still under warranty go right ahead but like me if you really didn't have time for repairing it don't risk it.
+	Muy buen desempeño y excelente diseño. Llevo probando tres semanas y todo ha funcionado muy bien. Todos los programas al 100%.
+	I was in search of a laptop that was thin, light, inexpensive, and capable of being my adorable travelling code sidekick--and though the search was more arduous than originally anticipated, this little guy filled that void in my soul to the point of overflowing joy and fulfillment. It's worth noting that, like others have mentioned, the Ubuntu install that comes on this computer has serious issues in terms of wireless connectivity. This was not really problematic for me, because I intended to install Arch from the beginning--and I did, and it works without issue. I imagine the issue is probably fixable via methods not involving installing another distro or a newer version of Ubuntu, but it's worth noting for those who may not want to deal with a laptop unwilling to immediately have reliable wireless connectivity (if this is descriptive of you, though, you're probably not the type of person who should be buying a machine with Linux pre-installed anyway).This laptop is seriously the most adorable thing I own; it's essentially the babiest laptop ever. All while being a reliable machine, too (which is the important part, though I emphasise the aesthetics). Good stuff.
+	I have owned a MacBook for over 6 years now and still runs like a gem!  I decided to upgrade to the MacBook Pro and I could not be more pleased!!  My MacBook Pro is reliable, looks great, and I have owned for almost 2 years and I haven't had any problems!  Much more reliable than my husband's HP Laptop, which is always slow and multiple other issues!
+	Moved from a 2008 Macbook to this machine...lights years ahead!  Great for music production!  I'm souping it up to 8GB tomorrow.
-	Laptop worked for exactly 6 months before the monitor went out. Two different technicians came out to fix it, couldn't fix it and requested to send to repair center. Warranty denied because they claimed that a slight ding to the corner of the case meant that the laptop was damaged and no longer under warranty. They do not support their hardware. DO NOT BUY SONY.
-	Disclaimer* may just be mine and a few other peoples, but I have read a review that was shockingly similar to my story. I Bought this in august 2013 and really liked the look, brushed beautiful metal, operated ok at first. games ran well. But windows crashed repeatedly. sent it in and laptop continually fails and windows has had to be re installed over 6 times and restored over 25 times. Currently running ubuntu which is awesome but i bought a windows running machine. I enjoy learning what is involved with linux but much prefer the simplicity involved with windows. Obviously that wont happen with this laptop though. as it is simply not functioning even after having the hard drive replaced by samsung the windows load would still crash every other reboot.Would not recommend to a friend. aesthetics are great cool looking but non functional.would recommend to any enemy i have.THIS GOES FOR ALL ATIV BOOKSSAMSUNG CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ATROCIOUS
-	I had the worst experience with buying a laptop on line. Not only did was it seven years old, there were a lot of minor problems. I called the company an he not only made excuses on why it didn't work but he tryed to sell me the items to fix it.  Loser!
+	Its a great machine for the Price that I paid for it, its better tan I was expecting. I recommend
+	Battery life seems a little shorter than what I expected from all the net reviews. But I'm just being picky here. Otherwise, great laptop to own and use.
-	I have had the HP Pavillion g6-2210us for a week and am very frustrated.  The computer had problems initially loading Windows 8 and it took a couple tries.  Trying to get Microsoft Office full version loaded was a huge problem with many shutdowns, freezups and error messages.  I couldn't install the HP Help and spent hours trying to get help.  The online chat for Hp did not solve the problem and referred me to microsoft help because my laptop wouldn't install office even though it will also not install Hp automated helper (not sure if that is the correct name) or Hp updates.  I still have not worked out the installation problem.  My mouse arrow freezes often doing very simple tasks and it has shut down out of the blue...it even froze and shut down during an angry birds game. It will not recognize a usb plugin mouse.  And these are just the problems I have encountered in my first 4 uses.  I am so beyond frustrated.  I just want to use this laptop for basic use, nothing fancy.  I can only think that the particular laptop I received is defective because this cannot be normal!  I love the solidness of this laptop and the keyboard (although mine has a couple warped keys that I don't think is normal?!)  I do really like the mousepad texture and sensitivity.  At this point, I feel like I just wasted nearly 500 bucks and wish it was returnable.
-	This computer is very thin and light, but is very fragile.  Before you purchase this one, you need to consider that this computer should be handled very carefully always.  I bought an SVP1321 model in Korea at about $1800, and have used it for about 8 months.  Actually, I had to change one within one month of purchase because the computer generated electric spark and noise at the main board.  Now I have one very serious problem - the LCD glass is broken by being fallen from a chair.  It would be my fault but the computer itself is not very stable because the main body is too light while the LCD part becomes a little heavier because of touch capability, I guess.  Also, anyone will notice that the hinge of LCD is something loose.  Being fallen from a chair, the LCD has collided with the main part, which breaks the LCD touch glass.  By being fallen, the inside, not the case, is broken.  If this computer is well designed, I believe that the LCD should not be broken.  I have not much problem in looking at the computer screen, but the touch does not work.  I tried to get service through Sony Korea, but have an answer that it costs about $650 to replace the LCD part  (upper cover).  If you have any idea only to change the touch glass at a cheaper price, please give me some advice.  Anyway, it was a wrong decision to buy this computer.
+	The computer is fast with tons of storage, however the HP helper app cause me some grief. Once I got the computer up and running the helper pop up with a message that the intel processors needed to be updated. Unfortunately, I pressed the button. After the undate,the computer would not reboot. Called HP, spent a few hours with them on the phone to eventually be told that I needed to reload the operating system or maybe just send the computer back. I sent a note to amazon that the computer may be returned which prompted the distributor Eluktronics Inc to call me and ask what was the problem (they called within 30 minutes of the e mail to amazon). They knew exactly what was wrong and I was up and running in 20 minutes. The problem was the update caused the computer to look for the operating system on the D drive rather than on the solid state C drive. I had to disconnect both normal drives so that the computer would be forced to look at the solid state C drive for the operating system. Also, you have to start and shutdown the computer twice. Once for the operating system and then again after you have reconnected the regular hard drives.Will at Eluktronics Inc was very knowledgeable and helpful. Without his help, the computer would have gone back to amazon.I would recommend skipping the update. I would guess that the problem only occurs with a three drive system and C a solid state drive (of course the solid state drive is why the computer starts and loads programs so fast). It was a pain to begin with, but I'm very happy with computer and the distributor once I got past the first big hurtle.
-	This machine is trash. I purchased from Office Depot and I've had nothing but problems. Machine has underperformed in every game and every benchmark I've used, including Passmark, 3dmark, Furmark, and more. I wasn't trying to play anything amazing on it either, just Dota 2, which could only run on low settings at a choppy 20-30 fps. Current benchmarks put the Radeon 8610G on par with an Intel HD 4600, but I've got one of those too, and this isn't even close. The memory is the worst part, 8gb of Samsung DDR3, single channel, that clocks about as slow as 2gb of DDR2. This machine is a joke, and doesn't come close to the promised performance.I've tried to contact HP customer support, and from my very first contact they agreed there was a problem, and shipped me a box to send it in. Well they shipped it right back and all they did was restore it to factory defaults, completing ignoring my very detailed description of the problems. When I called to ask about it, they had no idea what they were talking about, and all they could say was to send it back in again, and this time, the lady promised me, she would take personal responsibility for it, and would call me if she could not reproduce my problem. Again I typed a very detailed write-up of the tests I ran, and reiterated my desire to be contacted. Well, I never got that call, and today received an email saying they had completed repairs and had already shipped it back without checking with me. What did they do this time? They replaced the touchscreen. D'OH! Twice now I've sent this machine in and twice it's been sent right back to me without the problem solved, and not for lack of customer input either! Rest assured I've got some more words for them.TL;DR:  this machine is rubbish and HP technical support is either completely inept, or lazy and ignores customers' problems in hopes they'll just go away and deal with it. This isn't HP bashing--this as close to an objective account I can give, and I'm prepared to back up my claims if anybody has any questions. Bottom line though: don't buy this machine, and don't buy anything from HP at all if you have any notion that you might need support for it.
+	(This is the very first Apple I ever owned,( I have used them a lot before tho), so I dont know much about what comes with them if anything at all. This one only came with a charger)? AnywayUnfortunately I waited too long to check inside the package because when you buy a new computer you dont need the boot CD right away so I figured it was in there, inside the box, but much to my surprise I found out yesterday that the CD holder in the box is Empty!?I was wondering if the Seller does not include the Apple Boot CD with their new laptops? Or is this a mistake? Or is it extra? (I sure hope not cuz it is not the case with the PCs).How do I get my* boot disk?Thank You!*By "my" disk, I mean the CD that matches that exact model because they usually ship a backup copy with all the software etc, in case the HDD crashed or something happened which forced an OS reinstall.
+	I Took quite a while to decide on whether to buy this laptop. I was also considering the 13" MacBook Pro and the Dell XPS15z. All of them are worthy laptops. I was attracted to the XPS as it is very well priced and a great looking laptop. But in the end I stuck with Mac. I have been a Mac user since about 2002. So, all my private software etc is Mac. Switching back to Windows would have been a struggle as much of the software is not available on Windows and if it is, the look and feel and functionality is a step down from Mac. So then had to decide on whether I go for the 13" or not. I have always had the 13" models. In the end I went for the 15" because the sound is better and the sheer power of the laptop is brilliant. So much so that since getting this laptop I have retired my iMac i3, my son was very happy to inherit!In short then, you won't go wrong with this. It is beautiful, powerful, portable and the OS and applications are brilliant.
+	The 12" Powerbook G4 was my workhorse for 7+ years and I was ecstatic when Apple finally released a 13" Pro. I have had ZERO issues with this model in over two years. (I even had to send the PBG4 back to Apple twice for a hard drive and once for an optical drive). I absolutely LOVE this machine.  Have been a Mac user since 1985 and was also a Mac Genius.  This machine is perfect in every way.
-	My first Air (this exact machine) was purchased at an Apple store and replaced at an Apple store. The third was purchased from Amazon. I got three bad apples, and I think that about sums it up. I will try purchasing this machine in the next couple of years in hopes that I don't strike out again (I'm a sucker for a good product and I believe that Apple still can provide that).I imagine the issue I originally encountered, that I gave this product 1 star for, was simply a defect in manufacturing. I own an early 2011 MacBook Pro that I love. I am (was?) an avid Apple fan and I purchased the newest Air recently. I opened it up only to find that the screen was lopsided. The case seems to close with the left side coming down every so slightly sooner than the right, which makes the whole body of the computer lopsided. When the laptop is closed, you can see that one side is a fraction of a millimeter tighter than the other.As an academic and type-A person who spends a great deal of time on her machine, this is unacceptable. When I drop a grand on a piece of equipment, it had better be perfect. I didn't think Apple could disappoint, but it did. I (exchanged) this first computer and (opened) the next one in the store before leaving. Hopefully no one else encounters this problem and Amazon will allow your return if you do.Edit 6/25: The tech at the Apple store was incredulous at first, but when he saw the gap difference he willingly replaced it. My understanding is that I am not the only individual who encountered this. The replacement does not have the same issue; I now have an excellent computer to use for work and school and am pleased so far with how things are working. I'm not incredibly computer savvy, and this is the first Air I have owned, but for someone who needed something light, small, and fast, this fits the bill. Still annoyed (and very surprised) that the first go was a bust.Edit 7/13: The second computer, after a couple days of use, began to randomly go black. Nothing would be lost, nothing to indicate why this was happening. The screen would just go dark and I would have to wait five to ten seconds for it to turn back on and all would be like it was just before the screen went dark. Kind of like an old person nodding off while watching TV and then suddenly waking up. I did trouble shoot with Apple. No hot spots on, nothing amiss. I took it back to the store; they offered to replace it. Instead, I washed my hands of the new toy and decided to wait a while to see if this issue got resolved. I was so disappointed.Then, I saw the computer go on sale at amazon for the student discount price at apple, without tax, on the 10th of July. It felt too soon, but that was a great price. I had a nice chunk of change in points and gift cards with Amazon and thought- what the heck. I bought it again, thinking there was absolutely NO possible way I could experience an issue a THIRD time.Of course, the screen on this computer was lopsided as well, like the first one. Not as severe as the first computer, but bad enough that I sent it back to Amazon today.I give up, Apple. I want to love your newer products. I really, really do. But it seems like there are some serious quality control issues and bugs that need to be resolved, and I don't want to cope with those, despite my desire for a new computer (fortunately I don't necessarily need a new one right now). I hope my old pro will last me a couple more years. When it comes time to replace my pro, I'm not sure if I will look at Apple's products to replace it.
-	We got the laptop and within two days the wifi wouldn't hold a signal.We promptly sent it to ASUS for repair and there it sits. Going on week three now waiting on parts.We have four laptops in the house no a Samsung 2 Gateways and a Toshiba all with no problem at all.Needless to say. This will be the last Asus I will buy, and I would advise you to stay away.
+	I took a gamble on this laptop because it seemed that most reviews on any version of this laptop comments on broken wifi.The reason I took the gamble was thanks to another review that stated how to fix the wifi issue, but luckily when I received my Acer Aspire it worked fantastically out of the box.The first time you power it on it takes awhile to setup the files, but that's to be expected.Once the initial setup is finished everything is good to go. Wifi works fantastic. I had absolutely no issues with it.The touchscreen is awesome and I truly had no idea how much I would enjoy it.The backlit keyboard is fantastic.This is not a gaming computer! Don't go in thinking all your supposed game should work. Just a disclaimer.The only two issues I've had are:1. The battery isn't as nice as I would like. I probably get 3 hours of heavy use. I still haven't looked into an extended battery.2. About once a week you should completely restart the laptop to free up all your volatile memory.Overall, I completely love this laptop. I'm on it right now typing this review. It actually works so great that, even though it's 3 months old, I still haven't transferred even half of my files over because it's just so great out of the box.
+	My old 2008 MacBook is on its way out so with the new update it was a perfect time to upgrade.  I opted for the i5 model, before when I was researching MacBooks I was planning on upgrading the hard drive to 500GB, but now I don't have to!!  Thanks Apple!
-	I anxiously awiated the delivery of a Sony Z to replace my older TX series, and use my notebook as a road warrior and have always enjoyed Sony products.  However, this one disappointed me upon receipt as instead of spending an afternoon setting my computer up, I spent it on the phone with Sony Support.  If you look at the original listing/advert you see XP Downgrade listed about 3 times, however, a disc is NOT included with the computer, and after placing 3 phone calls to Sony Support, Parts & Accessories, and then Customer Relations, I have learned that one is not currently available with a delivery estimate given of November (it's currently August as I write this!).  This should be clearly noted in any advertisements, as many folks still use and rely upon Windows XP for work and I would not have ordered this computer at this time if I could not downgrade straight out of the box.  VERY disappointing.  I was angered enough to *not* find the downgrade disc included, but to learn that it was not contemplated to meet the release of the computer is negligent and misleading especially in light of the advertising.Other than that, computer looks nice, and reminds me of the TX/TZ with that extra inch or so that I always wanted without going to the size of a full notebook.  The power adapter is quite bulky and heavy compared with previous Sony Vaio power bricks and comes with a beefy 3-prong cord as well -- a lot of weight to add to an otherwise svelt computer.I am certain that others will buy and enjoy this computer, especially if you are OK with Windows Vista and don't require Windows XP for business.  But for those who do, it's a show stopper...and I would recommend that you wait until sony rectifies this and/or it is properly advertised.Software, especially an Operating System, is as important to the product as the hardware component.  Inasmuch as Sony didn't (and apparently cannot) currently deliver all that was clearly advertised, I am only giving the Sony Vaio VGNZ570N/B 1 star.
+	I purchased a "used" ( only 6 months old from org. purchase date) Apple Pro MacBook  13 inch screen..Got some upgrades plus a remaining 2 year Apple care warranty for $1164.00....An co- worker's son is in Apple support...took the computer home and checked it out and said everything looked good and that I got a decent deal. Now, I need to learn how to use it..LOL
+	This laptop is amazing. The resolution is incredible. It is fast and easy to use. All my life I was a PC user and it was not hard at all to change to this new system.
+	The product it's excellent, all Mac product are very fine products. I haven't any word for describe this product, only that i can say it's very good product. I recommend highly for all kind of person.
-	this product is horrible. there is poor sound quality and it shuts down at random times when you're using it. I would not buy this computer HP is definitely the way to go.
+	As a designer, I've been meaning to go Mac for a long time, and I'm so glad I did it. The Macbook Pro is as capable and user-friendly as it is beautiful. No regrets!
+	I've never owned a Mac before. I always had a hard time justifying the difference in price between a MacBook and HP Laptop. But after going through 3 hp laptops (because of viruses), and seeing my brother use his same MacBook Pro without ever having any problems I decided to give it a go. I CANNOT express how happy I am to be a Mac user now. It is head and shoulders about HP/Windows. I can't believe I used to be so negative about these guys. I would make my decision over and over if given the chance, and I recommend anyone that is in a position to afford a Mac, BUY IT! It's the difference between owning a Zune and an iPod. You can't compete with Apple.
+	To give a bit of background on this particular electronics purchase, I originally built my very first PC build from scratch back in the summer of 2008. It was middle-of-the-road by all accounts, but I was "stoked" to finally upgrade to the "dual-core" era. Specifically, I had an Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.53GHz. I also grabbed an Visiontek Radeon 4850 w/512MB, and 2GB of RAM. Again, nothing spectacular but it got the job done quite well.Fast forward almost 5 years and it was clearly showing signs of its age. The harddrive was considerably slower and made clicking sounds that I'm positive it's not supposed to make. My graphics card was idling in the 80's (C!), and 2GB of RAM just wasn't enough.So with all of that in mind, I decided it was time to upgrade. I went back-and-forth between a desktop and laptop for a few weeks but ultimately decided on a laptop. I initially tried the HP g7-2320dx with an A6 APU and Radeon 7460G, but it was just too slow. I returned that two days later and decided to wait for $150 in Best Buy gift cards to arrive, and also to take further time to check reviews and specifications. That didn't really yield much since on paper anything can potentially look good.So we made yet another trip to Best Buy, and happened across the new HP m6-1205dx with the AMD Quad-Core A10-4600M and Radeon 7660G. This combination is MUCH better. Boot times are quick and switching between apps is fast. And with that 7660G discrete graphics card I can play almost all of the most recent games (as of 2012) on medium settings (at 768p resolution). I haven't tried Diablo III yet, nor Guild Wars 2, but they are on my list, and if I can find some keys/codes, I'll gladly put this new laptop through the paces. I have all the confidence that this thing can run the games at a playable (read: 30 fps minimum) setting.As for features, the built-in camera is 0.3 MP...which is disappointing, but considering the price is only $599 (currently) it's hard to complain. It also features Windows 8 for better or worse, though I'll have to write up a separate article for that sometime in the future. Design-wise, it's quite sleek. That's what originally drew my attention; the brushed metal look. I haven't confirmed this, but I believe the top of the laptop/lid is metal, as well as the surface surrounding the keyboard, but naturally, the rest is hard plastic. But that's OK. Really, the only disappointing piece of this machine is the display. It's not so much that the LCD is bad, but the colors are a bit faded compared to my old 20" monitor. And again, I understand certain sacrifices had to be made to get this to a reasonable price point. Plus, I can always hook up said monitor (via VGA or HDMI) and use it as a second screen OR as the main screen and just turn off the laptop portion. So there ARE options.What really matters is the performance, and thankfully AMDs combination of the A10 APU and the 7660G graphics is up to the task.
-	This computer is absolutely terrible.  I thought that I could figure it out and find ways to speed it up and for it to stop freezing, but unfortunately it is just awful and now I am outside of my window to return it.  Luckily it was cheap, so I can just by another.  Be very careful though, with this computer you get what you pay for.Note that this computer freezes within seconds of turning it on when the only open application I had was internet explorer (or google chrome or firefox) and I was just on ESPN.Com or a comparable site.  I switched antivirus protection programs, paid for a cleanup (which is ridiculous since it is only 2 months old) and nothing worked.  It's just a piece of crap.
-	I was very excited about getting this machine. I have done my research and was expecting what will I get fairly well. I have read about the fan noise issue  but did not thought it will be a big deal, I thought how bad it could be,after all it is just a tiny fan after all, guess what, I was wrong.Unless you are always working in extremely noisy environment then this laptop is not for you. The noise is very annoying and those who say the noise is barely noticeable (I was deceived by them) must be deaf or at least have impaired hearing. Shame on you lenovo for not correcting this fatal malfunction all this time. Other than this annoying, irritating, joy-killing faulty fan there is nothing wrong with the machine but who cares!!
-	You have to be extremely careful when buying this product, the one that is advertised  and u think u are buying is not necessarily the one that u would get.....u have to read the FINE PRINTS to make sure ......ITS FRAUDULOUS!!!!!!! I wanted one with a CD drive, the one that I saw had everything including the CD drive but when i got my pc there was no CD drive. When I revisited amazon website where it is sold I saw in the very FIIIIIINE PRINTS that this model doesnt have a CD drive. So they are fooling customers, showing u a ":model laptop" with everything for an awesome price, so u think u are getting a "great deal" when in fact its not that way. Should I BE FOOLED BECAUSE I WANT A "GREAT DEAL" in this hard economic times. SHAMEFUL!!!!!To make matters worst when i got the pc, the battery stopped working ABOUT ONE WEEK AFTER.....it just stopped hold charge, i figured been new it may take awhile but after about 4 days  I realized the problem  was  NOT resolving. I contacted the seller through Amazon( approximately 11 dys after delivery), the buyer took about 10 days to respond and when he did his advice leaned towards me loosing my warranty LUCKILY I READ MY WARRANTY CARD BOOKLET so i didn't "tamper" with the computer as he wanted me to do. So when i responded with my concerns and told him that i wanted to return the product I WAS TOLD THAT THE LAPTOP WAS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN B/C 30 DYS HAVE PASSED SINCE DELIVERY and me initializing the "return" before the 30 dys DOESNT HELP THE SITUATION. So that's why the seller waited soooooo long to repsond the first time....hoping that my 30 days would run out.I cannot believe that this has happened and I will continue to write BAAAAAAD REVIEWS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND THE SELLER. AMAZON NEEDS TO SCRUTINIZE THESE SELLERS. I did business with amazon for many years because OF quality service.......SO WHAT IS GOING ON!!!!!! This product DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR RATING.
-	Dell has terrible technical support. Trust me bro.My laptop had paint coming off of it and the plastic was chipping off. So I call dell for some help and they basically kept transferring me four times. When I call them again after my call drop, they tell me to take pictures of my laptop.All they had to do was mail me in a replacement, but I guess they can't even do that. And still I did not get any replacement.If I was satisfied with Dell, I'd be diagnosed with brain damage.
-	When I start laptop the first time.  There are a lot of blue dot in screen.  When I play game ,the computer screen mess and then auto restart .
+	Amazing product! Very satisfied with it! Apple should monopolize and take windows products out of the market! I was a windows user but when I entered the world of Apple there was no turning back.
-	i was very happy at first with how easy it was to pick a product and pay for it, it arrived promptly and undamaged via us postal service. however, something was not right with the screen, i tried to contact the seller via email thru amazon just a couple days after receiving my laptop and he never replied. im stuck with a product that apparently has no warranty and i havent received any support from amazon.com or the seller. im not happy with my purchase.
+	After a few years of hesitation I finally "drank the kool-aid" and bought my first Apple computer, the MacBook Pro 13 in.  The biggest reason I put this purchase off is not because of the Apple products themselves, I truly didn't think I was good/smart/worthy enough of a Mac.  My fears were put to rest with the delivery of my MacBook this week.  Though it does take some getting used to, the startup-walk through and tutorial was very helpful and Apple was gentle with me.  It's actually more compatible with my non-Mac using cohorts and business stuff than I expected.This is truly one of the most positive  experiences I've had with a new computer purchase.  The performance is still amazing to me: quick, simple, direct and minimal fluff and fanfare (which takes up valuable space).  The swag is does offer is useful and also user friendly.If you are quasi-savvy with computer technology and have been debating on leaving the dark side, I recommend making the change.  You deserve it.
-	My mac air has been freezing for the past one month since I got this product. I really do not know why the heck it happens. Please help!
+	the computer is more then i wished forits a bit expansive as im not used to spending 1400dolars on a laptop but this one was worth iti also aditionaly put an ssd hd inside and now its one fast road runner.the only down side is when im on batery mode i cant play games ,they lag hard
-	Lets start off, I bought this laptop back in February 2011.  Within 1 month, My hard drive went out-which is a shock to me because it sits on a desk never being jostled or moved much. They try to get me to send in the laptop "It will take 8 weeks to fix and send back" to which i responded "Just send me the hard drive and I will install it myself". I got the hard drive timely enough and installing it was a nightmare. Take 25 screws out, then pry open the case top, popout keyboard and gently remove its wires, then unclip two other wires. Then of course i found out why the hard drive went out. Dell was too cheap to even include a HDD enclosure, so your hard drive is free floating attached to a sata connector. Everytime you rest your palm in front of the keyboard you are hitting the hard drive. Well needless to say I fixed it and it seemed to work for awhile. Then about two months ago the screen decided to go out. It had up to date drivers, nothing was wrong with the screen (no cracks etc.) it just randomly would go completely black then flicker on and off. My warranty ran out so I just decided i would scrap this computer and upgrade a netbook which seems to out perform this thing.  Never buy another Dell they are he**.P.S.  Customer service is provided by non native english speakers who have no idea what you are saying, in fact they redirect to everyone before you finally get a person who understands. I spent over 3hrs on a phone just to get them to send a hard drive.
-	Wasn't the Newest version. Not sure if this was amazons fault or the company who actually had the product. Should be fixed for future buyers.
-	My Satellite A-105-S101 is a year and one month old.  The motherboard failed and is costing me around $400 to diagnose and repair.  The more I look online at Toshiba's past problems and law suits regarding other Satellite versions, I would NOT purchase one.  I called Toshiba to get help and they were mean, rude, and unwilling to help.  I am very careful with the care of my laptop and have been since I made this major purchase.  Good luck if you buy one.  I'm an unhappy Toshiba customer and I will never buy from them again!
-	Well, would be a great computer - if it worked....  Ordered the cute little red PC from Sony direct....  Would have been nice if they loaded the operating system on to the computer correctly.  It is hard to imagine how a PC can pass Sony quality control if Windows was not loaded.Sony is going to take 10-14 days to replace it...  I have asked for a refund as I do not want to deal with Sony's poor customer service in the future.Think long and hard about buying a Sony PC...  In this day where you can get a computer basically at your local 7-11, customer service matters as much as the quality of the hardware.  In my case, Sony Customer Service let me down.Jeff Thomson
+	The Asus laptop is absolutely amazing.  Especially for gaming related applications.  I couldn't be happier with the Asus laptop for any use whether it be for business or pleasure.  The Asus laptop has amazing power given all the RAM and the Intel i7 processor.  It's definitely a gamers laptop for sure.  I'm very happy with the PC.
+	Has everything you need. I downsized from a 15 inch laptop to this and am glad I purchased this! Gmail, easily access to anything you need. I can fit this in my purse and it's very light.
-	This would have been a great laptop had the keyboard worked well. I type fairly quickly (80+ WPM) and whether running Linux or Windows (even in the BIOS), the machine will "double" certain letters. Most commonly would be turning every instance of ".com" into ".comm". Sony tech support told me to return the machine as this was a known problem and replacing the hardware would not fix the issue.
-	title says it all. besides the buggy screen the constant crashes i had my hard drive go twice. not replacing this time.one positive is I now externally back up everything on a regular basis
+	Its a very Nice Laptop I am only giving 4 stars for two reasons I hoped the keyboard was back lit and windows 8 is so annoying why there is no start button and you boot into a bunch of Microsoft add ons is beyond my consideration of desirable anyway once I learned that the desktop is not the boot page I then pulled things like control panel and computer to the desktop to make it less annoying but wow what were they thinking. OK So I was messing around with a computer game and hit F5  The Keys Lit UP So I changed my Review from 4stars to 5STARS  I am so happy
-	I bought a Sony VAIO VGN-FW280J/H 16.4-Inch Laptop (2.26 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo P8400 Processor, 4 GB RAM, 7200 RPM 320 GB Hard Drive, BD-RW, Vista Premium) Gray, in May 2009 for the good price of USD 999.99. I didn't open the box for about one month, because I have 2 other Laptops an Apple and a HP.Then I used this Sony for about 2 months as a desktop, but not that much, so I didn't move or bring this Sony on th go. Then for somehow it builds moisture inside the LCD, I believe due to the hot weather, I contacted Sony Support, they asked me to send the unit to Sony Repair in San Diego which I did and they received the unit on 10.05.2009. Yesterday on 10.20.2009 at 8 pm I got an email saying that the repair estimate is USD 699.99 plus tax, whaaaaaat?...I called right away asked them to send it back, this is crazy...I just can not believe that this is a SONY, one of the biggest company in electronics/multimedia/movie industry.I will never ever buy a sony anymore...Below is the email that I got from Sony Repair:Dear Valued Sony CustomerWe have completed the repair estimate for your unit based on theinformation you provided us.

+	This is my first Apple computer that I bought and wow..I don't know where to start.I was contemplating between the 13" and the 15" but there is such a big price difference.I am glad I chose the 13" because the screen size is perfect for every day use. Plus I don't need the i7 processor.Now to the review:I have had 2 Windows laptops in the last 2 years (HP and Acer).The HP harddrive crashed on me and the Acer is just way too slow.I bought the Apple MacBook Pro MD313LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (Fall 2011) version and I can't be happier.The first thing I noticed was how sleek it looked. It is all aluminum and felt like a well-built machine.After turning it on, it look around 15-20 seconds to boot up.The first thing you notice is how crisp all the icons and webpages looked. If you put the computer in maximum brightness, the colors are so vivid. I loaded my personal photo albums and the colors are vibrant. There is hardly any pixelation you get in other pc monitors.The keyboard is a chiclet type which feels so natural when typing. The trackpad is another great innovative part of this computer. You can customize the different gestures on the mousepad to make navigating a more enjoyable experience.The best thing about this product is probably the battery life. I got about 7-8 hours of use with average brightness. I never had this kind of battery life with other PC laptops. I had an ASUS netbook a year ago which gave me about 6-7 hours, but you get a slower processor speed and smaller screen. If you have copy of Windows 7, you can use this laptop to boot it and the interface looks so much better on this machine. You can use products like Pararell 7 or VM Fusion to toggle back and forth from Mac to Windows without ever restarting the computer.Overall, I have nothing bad to say about this product. The Lion OSX makes this computer a fun device to use. The speed is blazing fast. I never experienced any lag or slowness when opening multiple applications or programs. I can already say after using this for a few weeks that I am never touching a PC again!
+	Just purchased the newest MacBook Pro 13". This has the 500GB hard drive and I've replaced the stock ram with Crucial 8 GB. I also have a Mac Mini and was able to download all my apps and get up and running in no time. This size (13") is the ideal size vs weight for my needs. Everything about the design is well thought out. I am stunned at the quality of the power adaptor (Mag Safe), the backlit keys, the trackpad (pinch to zoom), and the outer shell are all top notch and well executed.At $1139, these are a great machine for the money.
+	This ASUS G75VW-DS71 have more then enough goody underneath the hood for an normal user ever going need to do everything and a whole lot more.
+	Pleased with laptop, small but efficient, came with proper software, easy to set up and use. No issues found, delivered as expected
-	Because it doesn't work - have been on vac - now will have to call to see if they will send me one that works - also now I have to send it back
-	writing on my old PC, not on my new SAMSUNG ATIV....after two weeks and a lot of time spent going through the required updates,( windows 8, samsung updates) and installing some programs (office, mozilla, etc), it now refuses to start. it simply would not turn on. I push the power button repeatedly, there is a little blue light comes on but the screen is blank and it remains blank if I leave it that way. The annoying thing was that it happened while I was traveling and needed the tablet to take notes and show some powerpoint files which I spent hours putting together. All gone.prior to dying, it did have wifi disconnection problems. it simply lost connection repeatedly. I would get a browser error, then I would had to re-connect manually to continue..., in retrospective the wifi problem is nothing compared to the whole thing being dead,Some things were nice about the tablet while it worked. As frustrating as windows 8 is, I could get some of my old programs to run on a tablet. These do not have yet equivalents in android  (Scratch programming for kids, Corel painter with a pressure sensitive pen).I am also not happy with Amazon's return policy for computers, which is none. In the past I had to return a laptop because it a weird hard drive sound, and they simply refunded my money. That peace of mind of knowing that I if the product is defective I can return it is gone.  Having shopped at Amazon for a long time, I did not bother re-reading the return policy, and it looks like I just got burned.....wish me to calm down...
+	Only 4 stars because when I got it, I ran the conventional update and it ended up departitioning the hard drive.Luckily the product still had Apple Care on it, so I was able to take it in and get it all set up for free.Works fine now, and I love it.
-	I am a proud owner of 2 of these machines. One with guarilla glass with only pen input, and one with pen and multi-touch (without Guarilla glass. I keep seeing sellers overpricing striped down versions of these x230t laptops with i5's and i7s with no webcam, finger print reader and only 8gb of ram, and some selling with no bluetooth! thats retarded. there are many x230t selling for $1,200 with i7, 360gb HD, 4gb ram WITH bluetooth, webcam, fingerprint reader for $1,200. Just buy 2 sticks of coarsair 8gb ram and install yourself. Bottom line these unit advertised here should only be selling for about $1,100 with these stripped down options. Check New egg, amazon, or just google these and find a way better deal, with better setting for only $1,200. aggravates me seeing people get ripped off
-	I like the performance at first but this monster is piece of garbage . I have had nothing but trouble. I only give it a 1 star because I can't give negative stars. AFTER ONLY A WEEK these are the numerous problems I have:- Horrible wifi.- The touch screen doesn't work well. When I touch it sometimes it just gives me like balls. Absolutely unresponsive.- The screen never rotates the way I want. Also unresponsive most of the time.- The screen will freeze sometimes when I bend over (I suppose more than 100 degrees).- Why doesn't the alt-ctrl-del work?- The reset button doesn't work at all!!!  The change of Function buttons is annoying.- The right ctrl button doesn't work until I drain the battery; that's how I resort to resetting.- The keyboard is just crap in general.- Customer support is horrendous.- The worst thing so far is I just get a blue screen and the mouse pointer but nothing else.I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT TROUBLE THIS THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!! I WOULD NEVER BUY ANYTHING BY THEM AGAIN. I have never wasted so much money. Hell, I have never bought such a bad product. Such is my hatred for them
+	I also have Lenovo T420 and Latitude E6420. And the mac book pro is way better than the other two, especially in terms of trackpad and display.
-	This is the first Toshiba laptop I've ever purchased that completely disappointed me. I bought this computer for my husband to use for travel presentations. It freezes frequently, charges slowly, and has a very short battery life. The worst design feature, however, is its complete lack of a VGA or DVI port. This means that hooking this laptop up to a projector is a logistical nightmare. A technician, who had managed his computer supply store for 15 years, said that he had never seen a laptop without at least one of these types of ports. I researched laptops pretty thoroughly -- I thought -- but admit I didn't specifically look to see whether it had a DVI or VGA port since laptops do typically have at least one of them. Now we're stuck with this lemon of a computer and will have to buy another computer. I can't recommend this to anyone since it freezes up for frequently and shuts down some programs (Outlook, for example). Do not buy!
-	NOTE: I purchased my Ideapad Z585 from Best Buy NOT Amazon. I purchased it for use with a computer course that I am taking this summer. It worked fine for 2 weeks. The sound and display were great.Just two weeks after I received the thing, it died and will not power on. I was working on battery power when it ran low, I plugged it in. 20 minutes later, it powered off. I searched the web and visited Lenovo's website and discovered that this is a VERY common problem with IDEAPADs.I tried all of the troubleshooting techniques found...including removing the battery and charging and pressing the power button several times at varying rates to release the static charge that may linger when the system powers off abruptly. I called customer service and must now mail it to Lenovo at my expense. It will take 7 days to repair. I have school projects due that I need this computer for and school projects lost now on the hard drive. OF COURSE Best Buy has an unconscionable return policy of 15 days from original purchase (note is took almost that long to get the computer to me despite paying expedited shipping), so now I have no options and no PC.In the future, I will purchase from Amazon or other companies who stand behind the products they sell and accept returns or exchanges within 30 days, which is the standard. I am very disappointed and disgusted with both Lenovo and will no longer buy their products.
-	This is an interesting product with useful features, from the ability to use expresscards to add connectivity and functionality to a lovely LCD screen. Review the features list carefully, and proceed if you need those features and can't find them elsewhere (expresscard slots, for instance, are increasingly hard to find).I was excited to get my new ThinkPad W530, but it was nonfunctional out of the box--something wrong with the communications sequence, from the motherboard to the antenna which makes any kind of internet connection not an option.  Lenovo tech support had me reload the OS, replace the hard drive, re-reload the OS (from media this time), use an ethernet connection (luckily I have one!) to run the dreaded Windows updates, run hardware diagnostics, and more.  All to no effect.  A decent company (and you know they're out there!) would have had me ship them the machine for repair and shipped a new one for me the same day and fixed up the defective one for sale later on.A month later, I'm finally in the queue for a repair which will take a week or so.  I have to deal with the repair process, evaluate the repaired machine, and had to argue with staff to ensure that I was still eligible to return the thing if I don't like the way it works when I get it back.Lenovo Customer Support, particularly on the sales side, is grossly inefficient.  None of the people you talk to when calling them with issues has real authority to help you.  This can be very frustrating if you are an individual or a small business.  Tech support is competent but not well linked to sales side in the event you need to return product, so techs lean to having customer make repairs on their end instead of asking you to send them the unit to repair at their leisure while providing the customer with a functioning machine.Do not purchase from Lenovo unless you have strong internal hardware support staff and a dedicated person to manage communications with Lenovo...or just really need a particular feature on their machines.  If you have issues with CS, press to speak with supervising staff and express concern with their process.  Currently, staff are reluctant to let you go to supervisors, probably due to internal regulations that penalize sales staff for putting customers first.  Perhaps they can improve.
+	First off, I got this laptop at BB.I have searched around for days on end looking for a laptop that is <$700 with good features and performance that can withstand some gaming and photo editing softwares with no problem. For a while I couldn't decide between this laptop and the Toshiba at staples (it has i7 quad core), but what ultimately led me to picking this laptop can be described below.GENERALMy first impression of this laptop is that it is very light compared to the traditional laptop/notebook style, however it is not light like you would feel in a sleekbook from HP or an ultrabook for that matter, but there is a difference nonetheless. The hood casing is brushed titanium and so is the inside. The bottom is plastic and is in black. The overall feel and look of the laptop was one of the reason why I fell in love with it (I love the look of brushed metals). The top part of the keyboard is a grill area with a "beats" logo on the far right. The great thing about this laptop is that there are more USB 3.0 here compared to the older USB 2.0 (It has 3 USB 3.0 ports and 1 port of USB 2.0). There's also a DVD-R drive for the occasional burning of DVD or CDs for your pleasure. The bottom of the laptop is very easy to take out if you want to upgrade the memory or the HDD. Also an FYI, it will fit a 9mm or 7mm SSD. The memory is PC3-12800 with a maximum memory of 16GB verified by HP and other memory websites (ex. Kingston and Crucial). There is a webcam if you're into skyping or google video chat, I don't remember the megapixel but the quality is adequate and not that amazing. If you're into security, it has a finger print scanner on the bottom right of the numeric keypad. It's pretty accurate and useful when you want to set up as logging-in feature or designate a password to a specific fingerprint. The screen is clear and pictures show up nice and crips. I didn't have any problem with the contrast or brightness, but that's my opinion.KEYBOARDThe keyboard has a backlit feature that can be turned on or off with a touch of a button. Typing is very smooth and quick. Each key is easy to press and spaced enough that it provide accurate typing at fast speed. I really like the design and functionality of the keyboard and it's one of my favorite feature about this laptop.BATTERY LIFESo it has a 6 cell laptop battery that last me about 3-4 hours depending on what I'm doing. At BB, it states that it'll go up to 5 hours of usage.PERFORMANCEAs for performance, it is quick and does daily task faster than my old dell laptop with an Intel i3-2.1 GHz processor. Microsoft applications and Photoshop opened up pretty quick and without any lag in between files. I don't do any benchmarks but I do know that even though it is an A10, it's speed and ability to process information might be a little slower than the new Intel IVY architecture--however, I don't need that much power. With AMD's A10 lower power consumption and good video card compared to the other Intel's chip, I find it more than adequate for daily use.AUDIOThe beats audio is...well, it's just speakers right? If anything, it falls just a little bit above the mediocre laptop audio if I were to rate it. It is a little bit louder than the average laptop and provide pretty good sound when played with the right type of music (like classical, acoustics, and some covers). It has a "bass" subwoofer on the bottom right of the laptop that "suppose" to deliver more bass compared to other laptops (Beats = Bass Bass Bass right?). However, I don't noticed that much of a difference in bass quality even with a good BEATS setting in the laptop. The sound delivery of this laptop is better if you were using headphones (I'm using a VMODA M-80). After you adjust some of the simple settings in the BEATS control panel, you'll be able to get "pretty good" sound from the driver. In fact, I think it sounds a lot better than my phone, computer, friend's computer, and iphone/ipad. After listening music via headphones and giving some time for the sound to sink in, I can say this Beats feature was a plus for me.MOUSEPAD/TRACKPADAfter using the trackpad for couple of times now, I came to realized that I can't use the traditional trackpad anymore. I really like the texture and "smootheness" and how easy it is to slide your finger without resistance. It's so convenient that the on/off trackpad touch-button is at the upper-left hand corner. The track buttons are also easy to press. When I'm surfing the web and youtubing, I find it is easy to navigate to specific areas on the page with just the trackpad. Two finger scrolling is responsive on this laptop. Zooming in and out is not as smooth but at most it's mediocre.By going to the start menu and search for "trackpad" --> "Setting" . You can change the different features on the trackpad. Ex. Four fingers swipe down to bring to Desktop. Left or Right to switch between applications. This was turned off when I got the laptop.POSSIBLE UPGRADEIf you're thinking about upgrading here's are the information again that this laptop comes with.Memory: 6 GB PC3-12800 at 1600. Max of 16GB (HP homepage and some website like BB/Staples/Etc will not list this)HDD: 750 GB at 5400RPMWhen I got the laptop, I installed a Samsung 840 series 120GB SSD and a Crucial 8GB RAM chip.I cloned the HDD with Acronis Image program via a bootable disk. After cloning, I checked to make sure my disk was aligned and it did. I also make sure TRIM was also enabled and disable defragmenter. All of these information can be found via google if you're looking to upgrade, but do so with caution.So what happen after I upgrade? It takes about less than 10 seconds for the computer to boot up so I can start opening programs. It resume from sleep practically in an instant and signing in with a fingerprint take less than 2 seconds. Shutting down takes about 10-15 seconds to completely shut down. Opening photoshop was drastically improved. Opening Word and PPT is practically instant. I haven't installed any games so I can't tell you how it affects gaming, but I supposed it's a little bit better since I got the SSD and the vast amount of memory.Another thing I want to mention is that after upgrading the SSD, I was able to get at least an additional 30-50 minutes of battery life. It last significantly longer and you can tell right away. This is one of my main reason to upgrade to an SSD because I hate to go to a cafe and have to carry a charger around, let alone trying to find an empty socket in a crowded room.WHAT WOULD NOT MAKE THIS LAPTOP GREAT:This laptop comes with a mediocre screen resolution. Certain images and icons aren't crisp and clear. The bezel and the screen itself is super glossy, this combination make it so hard to see what you're doing in bright lit areas--glares are horrible. I have a anti-glare screen from my school laptop which I'm planning to use.The hinges on most HP laptop, especially the envy line, are horrible and this laptop is no exception. When the laptop is closed, the hinges can be moved up and down if you're holding it with the hinges faced down (this is the result of the lid not being able to close completely). I wish it was sturdier but it's not, and this is one of my main problem with this laptop.The craftsmanship of this laptop looks great, but after looking at it closely (after having it for couple of days now,) it seems like the opposite. Certain area on my laptop seem to have very small crevices that pops out after a closer inspection. I'm not too picky on the details but I hope it makes up for its durability.SUMMARY+appearance / looks+audio+budget laptop+performance and features+finger print reader / security print+keyboard (easy to type) with backlit feature+weight (feels light to carry around)+upgrades-low amount of ram that it came with, I feel like it should've come with 8GB instead of 6GB, but if you're going to upgrade like me, it doesn't really matter. Just my two cents.-Windows 8?-Hinges-Glossy screen+bezel-Mediocre craftsmanshipHope this review helps!UPDATEAfter a week, I had issues with the finger print scanner not working when I logged in. On HP website, they posted the driver but the simple pass program was an outdated version. I first tried uninstalling and re-installing the driver, that didn't work. I tried uninstalling and re-installing the driver AND simple pass, that didn't work also. I came across a download from HP for simple pass + driver of an HP elite notebook (I don't know why they have it here). After installing that program+driver, it worked fine thereafter.Then a few days later, I had a problem with the audio jack, it didn't recognize my headphone or any headphone for that matter. The Beats equalizer setting was also messed up. I downloaded the audio driver from HP and re-installing it and that seemed to work. It's just annoying that these simple thing happened without reasons.After I resolved the two issues, everything is working fine.
-	11 month old computer stopped working after a shutdown, was told the motherboard was broken.  To fix this, I would be in as far as the cost of the computer.  The tech told me not to buy a Toshiba next time.  He said his research showed this is a common problem.
-	when i purchased this laptop there was a offer on purchasing the office 2010 at a great price, now i dont find it...how do i go about to purchase it???
+	Relative good cpu speedbig memory  (4Gb)big enough hard diskExcelent look y weightVery good product for the price
+	this will be my 4th one i bought through the years. never have a had to replace it because of its problems,  just because of human error. coffee spill. learned never pick it up by the screen  brakes.. but ive got these over and over for my family and they are great...
-	I've had my HP Envy m6 for about 2 months, and it is about ready to go into the trash.  I've heard the horror stories about HP laptops, and their unreliable software, but this computer seemed like such a great buy for its features.  Little did I know...Approximately every hour I need to reset my WiFi adapter, or reboot the computer.  I've talked to the HP technical folks, all from foreign lands with very thick accents, and they are incapable of fixing the problem.  The HP website has many people complaining about the same problem, and no fix will last for more than a day.Simple features, such as hibernate/sleep mode upon closing the lid, never worked properly.  I often have found the computer heating up in my briefcase, simply because it turned itself back on spontaneously.If I had the time, I would populate every single HP laptop site with this complaint, since the HP software problems are inherent to all HP products.
-	In many ways a good product, but rendered completely unusable by the horrible wireless card.  Apparently, this is a well-known issue with the Lenovo Yoga 13; in fact, as of this writing, there is a 64-page thread on the Lenovo forums detailing the frustrations everyone has with the wifi in these machines.  Lenovo itself hasn't addressed any of these concerns, but there are several suggestions on those pages for things one can do to help.  I've done pretty much everything recommended there -- downloading updates to the driver, changing the wifi power settings etc. -- and nothing has helped very much.  I'm still getting very poor range on the wifi, frequent dropped connections and frustratingly slow speed even when sitting right in front of the router, as I'm doing now.  By the way, it's not our router, because all our other notebooks and tablets in the house, of different brands and vintages, have speeds at least 10x what I can get with this thing.I'm going to see if Lenovo has the intention of addressing this issue in the near future, but otherwise this POS will be going back to meet its maker.
-	My week-old Apple MacBook Pro laptop just died. My first experience with a Mac has shown nothing but technical incompetence. Their automated phone support system doesn't work and took me half of an hour to get a person who then told me he couldn't help me because that was a different department. They gave a $100 gift card with the Mac which didn't work (even though at Coffee Bean, Starbucks, etc. I've NEVER had issues with gift cards). Now the laptop itself dies after one week.  I'm forced to deal with this company because I teach programming, but it's beyond me how this company has grown to the size it has.  The laptop is twice as expensive as an equivalent Windows laptop and three times as expensive as an equivalent linux laptop.How does this company stay in business? Especially a tech company that can't its tech right!  I love and use linux. I use Windows and it works. So far all I've seen from Apple is terrible support people and a terrible product.
+	I've been using Mac since 1994, this is my latest, and without a doubt, best constructed laptop from Apple.  I purchased the first MacBook Pro with the original CoreDuo processor, and then later an early 2008 Core2Duo, both had issues with assembly and when the disk was replaced the case never fit right again, however this version not only has a good looking assembly, it is maintainable longer term with a design that is much more solid.  Heat is far less of an issue than the prior versions (actually can use it as a laptop most of the time without discomfort from heat) and there are nice touches like the front panel sleep/display-blanked indicator led is hidden behind the aluminum skin with super tiny etched/drilled holes making it nearly invisible when not in use.
-	Do not buy this unit from Amazon, I did and found it inferior to expected performance. I requested a return authorization and followed the Amazon instructions, so far they refunded less than 1/2 of my purchase price. Notice said that I would get $159.00 of the $334.00 I paid.  I find the satisfaction guarantee to be a joke.  My advice to anyone is to buy a good laptop (if that is what you really need) from a reputable source - -  NOT AMAZON.  Please people learn from my mistake, I know that I have learned an expensive lesson.
-	This is a piece of junk. I can;t imagine how HP can still make  laptop like this and manage to sell, in 2012. You can almost say there as been zero innovation in this laptop since 2002 or so. I didn't buy this, got as my work computer from office. I am now forced to write the review give how bad is this laptop. In less than 2 months the battery is almost falling off!!. I have an extended battery and the battery lock is so poorly done and quality is so flimsy. Also, the laptop is really fat, unlike what you can see in the pictures. The Compaq laptop I got in 2001 was thinner than this and this was supposed to be HP's business class travel friendly laptop. What a shame to HP's design. Do yourself a favor by not buying this junk.
+	Bought this system in may 2011.  purchase and setup were easy. The hard drive crashed last week. Dell hard drives don't last long.
+	Great little computer for the price.Things I Love:Ubuntu - great operating systemSize/weight - at under 3 lbs, so easy to carry around.Capability - So many ports, OH MY!Hard Drive - nice size!Things I don't love:The mouse - difficult to use.  Find myself trying to Right/Left click and missing the mark.  It's all one button so it can get a little blurry if you're too close to the middle.100GB NTFS partition?  Yup it's just sitting there.  You can re-install or resize your primary partition to get rid of this.Sometimes it's a bit slow, but you have to expect that at this size/price point.Wish it had an SSD.  Obviously ridiculous at this price point.  I'll probably install one eventually for that extra umfMouse - sometimes I rub the mouse while I'm typingBattery - 2-3 hours isn't too bad, but I would love to have more.  Obviously, this would come at a cost of weight, so I'm fine :)Speakers aren't very loud.  I'll get by with this though.Don't let any of these negatives sway you overall.  Most of these annoyances aren't a big deal after a few weeks of use.  And the others would compromise the cost and weight value.I haven't had any WIFI issues myself.  Thing runs great.  I'm a developer, and being in a native debian/ubuntu environment is great.  All of my SVN tools and servers work wonderfully.  Even Compiz runs pretty well!
+	The 15" is worth it, it's not too small or too big and heavy like the 17". the 17 has it's place like home or office. the 13" is slower, check out the i5-i7 spec's.  The duel boot to Windows7 or Mac is too cool.  I got the square trade 2 year just in case.
-	I bought Toshiba M305D-4830 on Sep,2008. I didn't use it until November,08. But as soon as i open it. I want to send it back. These are major problems:1. It can not wireless automatically, I have to buy a wireless USB adapter to go on line.2. The Keyboard 3,e,d,c key won't work  period. so I have to use tablet pad, I call the service get no help, he just give the service number and want me send to bestbuy, because we lost our receive(That the biggest mistake I  made), I google the problem, I am not along, I try all the suggestion people gave still won't work,  anyway since I am the computer person myself so I go on line pay $85 buy a new keyboard.3. Freeze itself a lot, I have MCAFEE Anti-Virus so I know it is not cause by the virus.This machine is a junk.
-	Do not buy this product if you want to have nothing but issues.  The customer service is horrible.  They are rude and we have had someone out 3 times and now they want to send it in.  People depend on computers and there is no reason for the rudeness of their customer service.  I have worked on computers.  The technician installs a faulty fan and won't come back and fix it.  NOW we have to send it in.  This is all same problem, 4 times and they will not fix it.  Buy with care.
-	PRO: The design is world classCON: Very SLOW. I am surprised that Sony would use Vista operating system for this. Don't they have quality control? The product is almost unusable under Vista.SOLUTION: Downgrade to XP then you will have function and style.
+	Quick ship and was as promised. I had an even older version of this computer, but this newer version is much quicker and has  very good battery life.
+	I'm an IT professional who designs websites, I'm a musician who records audio tracks, and a hobbyist who likes to edit videos.  I own this very same computer, although I didn't get it from this particular vender I still feel pressed to comment on it. I have owned this computer for about 6 months now and I haven't had not 1 issue with it. I've edited many HD videos with no issues, and I've recorded and edited live audio and midi tracks using a very heavy music program. I am able to use this computer for both work and play with no issues. The physical design is very nice as well, the all silver aluminum body adds durability and attractiveness to it which in my personal opinion looks a lot like an HTC one lol, which is a good thing. I love the keyboard, I noticed most laptops are switching to the separate key style, this keeps the keyboard cleaner and it's easier to type on. I have no complaints man, this is awesome, I loooove it.I would highly suggest getting one if you're into video and music editing, or you're just interested in a well priced laptop with good specs. oh yeah, and the battery life is great, but I'm probably going to get another battery just to be safe.
+	I recently purchased this MacBook, and I'm very satisfied overall. The styling is attractive to the eye and it's a very powerful little machine. 15" really feels perfect compared to the 13" or the 17". The i7 processor makes this computer really fly. There hasn't been anything that I've tried tht this computer can't handle. I did install windows 7 on it through bootcamp to play a few games. The dedicated video card handles all modern games perfectly and can do max graphic settings on almost all of them.A special note would be to mention that this computer does get very warm while doing heavy graphic work. This is completely normal and is why it is considered a portable computer rather than a laptop. It is very uncomfortable to use on your lap due to the heat. I'd strongly recommend a portable desk if you do choose to use it on your lap. I bought a Logitech portable desk and it runs perfectly without becoming uncomfortable. Great computer!
+	I ordered this unit used through the Amazon Marketplace.  I needed a Macbook Pro with a built in optical drive due to the nature of of my work so I didn't want to get the latest model of the Macbook Pro.  Although this review is not for the seller, I will just say that this laptop was in pristine condition and everyone that I have shown it to says that it looks brand new.That said, the Quad Core i7 in this machine is perfect.  The only thing i did is upgrade the RAM.  It is very fast for all tasks and I do a lot of media heavy (i.e. - audio and video editing) things that require a lot.  Is it a Mac Pro?  Certainly not, but by necessity I do much of my work on the go and a desktop is out of the question most of the time.Even though this machine is a couple years old it has more than enough horsepower for 99.9% of standard computer users and even though for power users.  If you want the latest/greatest like Retina display, thinner, lighter, then this isn't for you, but if you want an laptop with a built in optical drive that still delivers on the power side, this Macbook Pro definitely delivers.  I got my unit for just over $1000 which I felt was a great deal, especially given the perfect condition.  It's a good deal if you don't want to pay full price for a powerful computer.
-	I had to send 3 of them back because the 1st one had rattling inside of it and the other 2 had keys sticking. I dnt blame amazon because I think its ASUS fault for not checking their items before packaging them.
-	The overall quality of this laptop is poor. It is made with weak plastic. Sometiems when I lift it up I feel like the screen will snap off.The first tiem this laptop died on me was right after I got out of class, its screen suddenly stopped working. I hooked it up to a external dispaly and it worked, meanign ti was probably something wrong with the screen.I rma'd it and found out it was a bad motherboard and they had none in stock and I'd have to wait longer for the part to come in.The second issue is the itnernet adapter tends to be glitch and always has an annoying popup.Third issue is overheating. After receiving it back from their "motherboard replacement" It started hitting the 80C's quite easily(Even after I reapply the thermal paste). Not to add that the hindge covers were very loose after reciving it back from them. Screen qualtiy is crappy and I've had problems with the mic.After they replaced the motherboard I Got BSOD's and then they requested me to format it. I formatted it then started having issues with SCM.I'm not too amazed with the GT70 either.Power Brick buzzes sometimesOn the side note, my GT70 2OC-065US runs with 16gb of ddr1600 and 1 SSD and 2 1 TB HDD with a caddy.Since its so heavy. its easy for you to accidently knock the power charger head a bit with your knee while lifting it up(Really have to wonder why they put the power socket on the back than the sides) this is probably why other manufacturers don't keep their charging sockets directly on the middle of the back....After this experience... I Wouldn't recommend any msi laptop to a friend.
+	We ordered three of these. All of them arrived on time and as expected. These have all of the features we require for our employees. great laptop for the price.
+	I needed it a new computer for work. This offers a lighter version of previous Acer that I had for years. I like the new touch feature.
+	When I was researching this product in while in the process of trying to find a new laptop, the word "intuitive" seemed to be bandied about by both Apple and its acolytes.  After my purchase I am happy to report that intuitive is not merely a buzzword but a fantastic adjective to describe this wonderful machine!  The trackpad is nothing short of amazing and will certainly ruin any other impostor you might be familiar with using (my old Dell's feels terrible by comparison).  The entire package is wonderful and the backlit screen and keyboard is a welcome feature that you will certainly enjoy.  I could go on and on about why I am incredibly satisfied, but I'll just stop by saying that if you are willing to pay roughly $1,000 on a laptop that will probably last you the better part of a decade you cannot do better than the Macbook Pro!
+	I have had this computer for more than two years now and haven't had any problems. Recently, I updated it to the most recent OS version (Maverick, 10.9) with no change in performance. The battery still works about as well as when the computer was new, i.e. it runs for 5-6 hours.Spilling coffee required around $300 worth of repairs, but it was probably worth it.
+	Laptop functioning great so far.  Some drawbacks, but minor enough to ignore, i.e. blue ray does not seem to output to an external monitor even when dumbing monitor output down to the laptop's max resolution of 1370 x 768 (???) or whatevers but playing blu ray on the laptop is great. I like Toshiba's update application.  Was not able to connect to the Toshiba Registration site, but that is a separate issue from the laptop itself.  Aluminum burnished chasis feels a bit weird feeling esp when I am resting my wrists on the latop using the keyboard.  Have not tried the USB 3.0 yet.  What was sorta interesting was that this was advertised as having a 500gb HDD, but when I did a systems check, it shows about a 737gb HDD (686gb shown as available total).  So I got a free 237gb upgraded HDD.  Would give this 5 but the packing not so good.  The Toshiba box was placed in an Amazon box larger, maybe about 20%, and there was no packing material inside such several of those inflated plastic air bumpers.  When I picked up the delivery from the USPS, Amazon box had some dings almost bordering on the serious and the Toshiba box also had a ding on one siide, crushed inward a bit.  But laptop seems okay and will keep working with it to make sure no issues resulting from those dings.  As it stands, excellent replacement for my old Vista box.  Aside from the questionable packing, would immediately recommend this latop to anyone wanting a 15.6" laptop with WIN7, I7, etc.
+	Very nice computer that may not still be available. Great price from Amazon! Easy to use straight out the box with OS 10!
+	fantastic laptop. definitely very expensive but you're getting a high quality product. i wish they got rid of the optical drive and put in a 2nd hd. optical media is dying and i never need it.if you're going to buy this, you must get the high res & anti-glare for $150 extra. it's definitely worth the money
+	I have always loved ASUS products and their Gamer's Republic line of laptops is no exception.  I get more for my money than any other system and it runs perfectly.  Unlike a lot of other gaming systems, the video card and ram are of good quality and ASUS makes these laptops upgradable and they have a good lifespan.  I'm still using my older G72 model as a backup system without any problems.  If you're a gamer and don't want to spend $5k on a system that can handle heavy graphics games, try this one out.  You won't regret it.
-	This computer has not worked as good as advertised. I am ill ,bed ridden, I play games on Pogo, this computer will not hold some Pogo games, will not hold  Java for some games. I have taken to a sales computers and was told the Java system and Windows 8 and Pogo programs are not working together.  I can not return the computer,to late from date of sale, goes to show you bad  merchandise is sold with no sales person to help leaving customers wander what to do next. .
+	This laptop is perfect. I extremely love the battery life, it can last up to 6 hours! Also I love the OSX Lion operating system. It is very easy to work with, and awesome multitasking. The only problem is that it is not 100% compatible with Windows 7. More than 80% of the files are compatible, but not all. Overall I love the Laptop.
-	This is not only the "worst" and weaker version of the new Zenbook Prime line, but it also comes with the VERY slow SanDisk SSD. Not recommended. And on top of this, Amazon is selling it more expensive than many other online stores, which are selling it at the real price of $1099. Avoid buying this one from Amazon this time around.
-	the first 3 months of having this laptop i had problems. It started over heating and just turning off. Then i had to replace the motherboard which cost me 500 bucks...now after a year the battery has a  issue. Now i have to replace the battery. I loved the overall look of the laptop, it had me at first glance and like the lil remote it cums with. But if you want a functioning laptop to get the work done, do not buy. This product is a waste of money...It total sucked...Just wished i could have returned it.
-	No instructions!  very confusing operations. Can't find half of the stuff I have been using over the last 18 years.I hate Windows 8. Most of the 'F' keys are useless, and their function is changed. Changes should be for improvements. This is going in the WRONG direction! I wish I had never bought this computer. I could NEVER recommend this computer to anyone.I love the speed, and the screen size, but I can't do anything with it. Maybe play games...  I am currently using my old Toshiba, at least I can do something with that!
-	I've had this computer for less than 3 years and it is ready for the garbage. I've had to put in 3 hard drives and now the screen is flickering to the point where I can't use it anymore. I refuse to put more money into it so it will go in the trash. What a waste! DON'T BUY DELL!!!!!!
+	This is my first macbook and I love it so much. It is beautiful from the outside and it runs fast and works efficiently.
-	I have another model Acer touch screen laptop, so I figured price wise this would be more economical for my sister. She's only interested in social media, light word documentation and picture viewing. However this laptop loads very slowly, it processes info so sluggish at times I think I'm using an out dated version form early 90's. As a company I love Acer but they dropped the ball on this one, and wish I had some decent review to give but don't. I could be completely wrong and got a lemon, but this was my worse purchase ever on Amazon and I shop here weekly. Sorry
-	I like everything about this laptop, on paper. I was willing to pay a bit extra to get the vaunted "Sony reliability" Very shortly after one year of use, the computer stopped booting. Sony was no help. This will be my last Sony product.
+	Still learning the new operating system coming from a lifetime of PC (and having a blast doing so).  The first thing you notice is just the elegance of the device.  Apple ensures you feel like you are holding onto a precious metal (aluminum in this case). Looking forward to learning the device and pairing it with my iphone and ipad2.  No regrets, even if it was over a grand!
-	It was cheap so bought it for Black Friday. However, the mouse pointer jumps when least expected while tapping. Its quite slow. Its not dual or quad core.keyboard is not too bad.display contrast as with dell is not great.
+	My son loves it.  At 18, this is his third.  We covered this beautiful aluminum shell with a purple plastic case.  It will protect the aluminum and be NYU color coordinated.
-	The mouse was the problem with my newly purchased HP laptop.  I returned it and got my money back.  I love Amazon, but I will stick to seeing my electronic merchandise in person.  It might no be Amazon's fault, because I saw the UPS man drop my laptop several times, before it got to my door.  Buying it in person will eliminate you from returning it.
+	I must say, I am very impressed with this Laptop! One of the best things about it is its trackpad, the multi-touch gestures are awesome! The backlit keyboard makes it easy to type in the dark, the HD webcam is nice, the Intel HD Graphics run Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4 without a problem! The computer runs very quietly (when not playing heavy duty games)! The aluminum unibody looks awesome! Overall I am very happy with this laptop and I recommend it to everyone!
-	Lets get this out of the way.  This notebook is BEAUTIFUL.  Sleek, sexy, and fast.Now the bad part.  I needed to reinstall Windows 8 due to some major errors that popped up.  Asus said I needed to RMA the unit so they could reinstall windows.  They would not give me the software to do it, they insisted I send the computer away for weeks.  Just to reinstall the OS.  I'm not kidding.Don't deal with these jokers.I'm returning mine tomorrow.
-	This whole experience has been horrible.  60 days after I get it the power supply goes out.  I ask Amazon for help and they tell me to send it in for warranty...it's out of their hands.  I send it in and the warranty policy is to send you a new machine if they can't repair within 7 business days.  14 go by and I ask for a replacement.  "Oh we're sorry sir, your part is coming in next week and we'll ship soon thereafter."  I get the unit back and within 2 hours, all kinds of s*** starts to go wrong.  From the time I turned it on the fan was rubbing against something and sounded like my bike when I was a boy after I put a playing card in the spokes.  I send it back to warranty for a second time and they call to tell me it has to be replaced.  I get the specs and Lenovo is trying to slip me an i3 processor instead of the i5 it came with.  Both are third gen processors.I'm ticked at both Amazon and Lenovo.
+	I have been using my new mac book pro 13 for one month, and it is excellent so far. I love it so much,
+	I got my Toshiba satellite A135 S4527 in April 2007, its worked great for me almost 3 years now.  No problems at all to report, except that Vista sucks compared to XP.  But, that isn't Toshiba's fault and I could always buy XP to replace it.  The laptop was a good deal at the time, I paid $599 I think and have no regrets about it.  One of my better purchases, I might stick to Toshiba since I had a good experience with this one.  A friend of mine has a really high-end Toshiba and its also 3 years old, and very nice, lots of extra stuff on it.
-	I did not like it at all!!!very distracting and my kids make a mess on it and they try to take it away from me.It is not a very good influince on kids and adults.It will keep you up all night playing on it and making emails in the middle of the night.i did not like it what so ever.!!
-	I bought this laptop 4/2011 and I loved it for the most part. There were a few moments where the touchpad went screwy but it always went back to normal. 2 months out of warranty, the ac adapter stopped being recognized so the battery wouldn't charge. I bought a new Dell ac adapter but it didn't read that either. Then I trucked over and bought a new battery - still no luck.  I spent a hugely frustrating 1hr+ on the phone getting bounced around and repeating the same info. One guy told me he would "test it remotely" and put me on hold for 45 minutes, saying he was checking things. CLICK. He hung up or got disconnected. Next rep had no record I was even talking to anyone and said they couldn't even test things remotely. I then got passed along to sales guy when I started getting ticked.Sales guy told me it was probably a BIOS update, not the motherboard as everyone has speculated. So I used the new battery to attempt to update the BIOS. BIOS won't update unless battery & ac adapter are plugged in.  In the meantime, the new battery charge is out so I buy yet another battery to attempt this supposed fix. Won't work and can't find google solution that helps so I call again. This time, I'm told you can't update the BIOS unless battery and adapter are plugged in. So I'm in a catch 22 and it still doesn't work. Lovely reps told me I can pay $390 for a new motherboard. Um, no, that makes no sense.  The final straw was the Dell rep offering to help me select a new Dell product. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? My last Dell desktop had to have a motherboard replaced, but that was under warranty.I have since read about many problems with Dell and their mohterboard set ups and issues. Don't worry though, one rep told me she'd pass along the message that they should offer external battery chargers. I'm not sure she'll pass along the message that I'd rather have them work on motherboards that last longer than a year. I am shopping for a new laptop and will never use Dell again.
-	Gents - I bought the new Macbook Air 11.6 last month (mid-August 2013) in the states through Amazon, replacing my reliable Macbook Pro as it was too heavy to carry around all day.  What a mistake.  My MBA IS A PILE OF JUNK! Cheaply constructed and I have the same problems - WIFI dropout - severe.  I live in shared housing in Brazil and I a few flatmates share one router that has never given anyone any problems nor me with my old Macbook Pro.  The Dropout of signal happens EVERY 2-3 minutes.  Yes, EVERY 2--3 MINUTES I have to put the MBA into sleep mode, reboot and get another signal which lasts another 2-3 MINUTES.Please imagine this...I pray that any download I do is over in 2-3 minutes, if it isn't, I have to repeat the procedure again.  Any video that I watch on youtube has to be over in 2-3 minutes, if I read an article online, immediately after reading, I have to reboot the computer.  After reading and responding to each email, I have to reboot, and a facebook chat?  Forget it.I feel like suing apple if I only knew how!  Really!!  I feel I've been totally robbed!!!  What are they doing to sort this out???!By the way - I couldn't post this - by the time I finished writing - guess what????....Yeah you guessed, just came back from rebooting!Between taking it back to Brazil and trying in vain to solve the problem myself, I have missed the amazon return date and am lumbered with a wifi useless machine.  It seems this is big news on the internet but apple are doing nothing about it.After doing some research on the internet it seems I am not alone, thousands are having the same problem:[...][...]
-	Received my anticipated package today! I just unboxed the new ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A-AB71 from Amazon's deal. It was a pretty sweet deal for a 1080p screen ultrabook. The unboxing and boot-up to setup was all smooth and standard. This was going to be my awesome gift to someone.THEN I started typing... The keyboard DOES NOT WORK properly! There are a couple of keys that simply do not function! The "D", "Back Space", "Left Arrow" keys DO NOTHING (who knows what other combinations will fail)! This fresh new ultrabook have one of its core functions completely not work. The keyboard did not have to be fancy or anything; All it needed to do was register the pressed key! I tried updating Windows with all the drivers but the problem is still there! I want this ultrabook to work so badly. I even like it, but how can I now?!How can ASUS who has received many complaints regarding this problem (down to the exact same keys!) not fix it and continue distributing this garbage ultrabook? I Googled the issue and saw videos and comments regarding this exact problem.[...][...]Further reading suggests that this is a hardware issue with the soldering or pins for the keyboard.Come on ASUS, an 8 yr old could QA this and know that the keyboard does not work. What kind of quality assurance is this??! And why so silent about this issue and not fixing it immediately?The only thing ultra about this ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A is how ultra-fail the keyboard is. This is ASUS quality here, people. Take a look.This whole thing sucks because:- Opportunity lost on buying other ultrabook deals during Black Friday sales.- Time loss to drive 7 miles one-way to UPS to pick up package (and perhaps returning later).- Time wasted on highlighting this issue up to Amazon, ASUS, and various customer support.- Management and handling of packing/shipping or dealing with returns/RMA.- Huge letdown for a holiday season gift.- Back to square 1 with no ultrabook gift.
-	I just bought this item for my friend. But I found something is wrong when my friend received and showed me. The hard driver just 360GB, no fingerprint. It's totally different from what the seller wrote omline.
-	I've had this type of Laptop in the past and I had wireless problems so I switched to Dell. I liked the design of this laptop and decided to take another shot at HP.  The keyboard stopped working after 3 weeks of little use.  I'm in Latin America and took it to the local HP rep and they didn't want to honor the warranty nor repair it because it was not a model that had been marketed down here.  Terrible product with lousy service.
-	I really wanted to like the Zenbook because the form factor is so great. Size and weight are great, battery life is great, the instant on is amazing! But the downsides -- The mouse pad is a joke, it constantly confuses a touch with a click so you will drag or select things you did not expect, and the reactions are not consistant. I suggest you use an external mouse with the Zenbook. Mine failed after 4 months, looks like it is a complete power failure at random times. I will provide an update on the RMA process and the repair.Not sure I like the trend in notebooks of no LAN connection and no VGA connection except with dongles. Also I really noticed the lack of a speaker on/off and volume control. It is a pain to have a set of keys with multiple presses for volume. The ideal netbook needs to have built in LAN and VGA connections, and volume controls.
+	Very satisfied with this product. Its well worth the investment to have this very dependable machine and cutting edge software loaded on this laptop. I did purchase MS Office (no e mail) since as a business person I must use also most records are kept on PP, word or excel. To sum up, this laptop meets my requirements and I'm very pleased with Amazon's quick delivery of this product.
+	I'm a web developer/designer and consider myself fairly computer savvy. I have built several computers from the ground up and was surprised when I found exactly what I wanted at Best Buy.I have been researching laptop computers for the past 4 months and consider the Sony Vaio VPCS111FM/S to be the best option for the price.Pros: Intel Core i5 2.26 GHZ, 500 GB hard drive, 4 GB of RAM, 13.3" screen, 5 hour battery life, chiclet backlit keyboard, Blu Ray player, Video Card has 256 MB dedicated RAM, 2 year warrantyCons: Price($1050.00), hard drive is only 5400 rpm and Out of date Bios that caused a minor audio problemI was looking for a powerful portable computer that didn't cost a fortune. I found cheaper laptops that had the same specs but they were all 15" or larger which was a deal breaker for me. Also, most of these models came with a battery that only lasted 2-3 hours, which was also a deal breaker (the Vaio standard battery last just under 5 hours).I think the reason this has received some bad reviews is because the installed bios and drivers are out of date resulting in a few minor bugs, most notably unexpected audio drop outs or a buzzing metallic sounds while listening to audio. The Vaio Update software that comes installed won't update the bios automatically - you have to download the latest version from Sony's website and install it manually. This is very easy to do and after the bios is updated everything works perfect.I have installed Gimp, XAMPP, FL Studio, Inkscape, Netbeans and iTunes and so far they all run better then expected. I also tried out the wireless display feature with the NETGEAR Push2TV Adapter that was included in the price. I watched some Netflix movies and it worked great.I have only owned this machine for 3 days and so far I love it and am extremely happy with my purchase. If you are looking for a highly portable powerful computer for around $1,000 then this is the machine for you. I don't think you will find a 13" model with all the same features for the price.
-	On July 17, 2012 I ordered ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A-AB71 which I order on my personal account and it was returned 3 days latter (see my review here: www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FQKE46RBPSBN/)On August 11, 2012 I decided to order UX31A-DB51, another model of Zenbook for my business trip abroad. I needed laptop that would impress my business partners (yes in some countries appearance is important... like Russia) it arrived one day before my departure. I left without turning it on hoping that first one was just a lemon and this time everything will be smooth. Was I wrong!When I arrived to Russia and finally turned it on I screamed, the screen had this weird nebula/milky way looking defect (kind of like our galaxy of you look at it from the side, just google image search "milky way infrared" and it looks exactly like that). The defect is about 4 inches long and 1/2 inch wide almost in the middle of the screen. It is visible only when laptop is on and REALLY stands out on darker background (if connected to external monitor the defect is not visible). Out of respect to my business partners I decided not use ZenBook for presentation purposes and had to buy another laptop in Russia at great expense and put ZenBook back in the suitcase. I was MAD!My trip was 3 months so I could not return it back to Amazon. Now I'm back in the US and decided to start using the ZenBook with external monitor. Hooked it up and 10 minutes latter I'm writing this review.As in my older review of UX31A-AB71, UX31A-DB51 had same problems and more.Of course Trackpad/Touchpad is horrible and is still unusable even after the updates. ( External mouse helps)Video play back for files on hard drive is horrible and jerky as if I'm plying it over the network on super old laptop with no memory and cheap video card. VERY frustrating and is not acceptable.Physical memory is always running at 70-80% from the start I guess due to all the Asus junk applications and services.And of course it still wobbles on marble table it still rocks back and forth just enough to start hating it.WiFi is unusable, it is on and connected, but the speed is about 0.05 Mbps  where as the rest of my computers are running via WiFi at 5Mbps as they should.I'm furious, but not sure what to do. Window of opportunity to return it back to Amazon has passed, but I really do not want this brick in my house. Do any of you have an advice on what I can do? I do not want to send it to Asus for a fix. I do not want this thing period and would love to get my money back. I freaking HATE ZenBook Prime, I actually started to hate the very words "Zen", "Book" and "Prime". I want this filth out of my life and I want my hard earned money back in my pocket. Any ideas? Should I file BBB claim on Asus? Should try to deal with Amazon and hope they will understand the situation ( I have plain tickets and visas in my passport to proof the trip to Russia)I literally turned this abomination on only 10 times and spent at most 10 frustrating hours on it. Needless to say I will not be ordering Zen line and may be any of the Asus products EVER again. (Oh, I forgot to tell that the part where speaker are has cracked (remember I opened it 10 times) so no, it is not sturdy.My first review had the sum up: Trackpad = MASSIVE FAIL, Video Playback = MASSIVE FAIL, WiFi = FAIL.This time:  Trackpad = MASSIVE FAIL, Video Playback = MASSIVE FAIL, WiFi = MASSIVE FAIL, Build = MASSIVE FAIL
-	After 2 months of light use, the hard drive crashed on this PO$ computer.  Overheats and knocks out the hard drive.  This problem is apparently intrinsic to this HP model.  If HP wanted to do the right thing, they would recall these from vendors and refund the money to those poor saps (like me) who relied on good reviews and purchased one.
+	Better buy this one. Throw away the hard disk. Put an ssd on it and it will fly. I am running avid media composer on it cutting full hd movie in it with no effort. Top notch
+	I just recently purchased one of these laptops.  I had mine customized by Apple - a 1680x1050 high-res screen and 500GB 7200RPM hard drive instead of the 750GB 5400RPM.  I am extremely glad that I did.The screen is wonderful on it.  I previously owned a 2008 MacBook Pro 15.4" with a 1440x900 matte screen, and I much prefer the glass-covered high-res screen on the new one.  I sat them side-by-side and the color difference is tremendous.  Obviously, the pixel density on the new one is also iPhone4-like, and great for typing or reading.  At one time I had a 23" computer monitor that was the same resolution as this 15.4" MBP, so it is really amazing.  It's also great how easy it is to really clean the screen on this new computer - since it is all glass you can put a bit of water on the cleaning cloth and it gets perfectly clean.The internal hardware in this new MBP is also flat-out incredible.  I have purchased Windows 7 Pro for it to run in Boot Camp in case I need it for work and had a very interesting find.  I also own a self-built gaming desktop I made a couple of years ago, which scores a 5.2 on the Windows Experience Index.  Get this - the new laptop scores a 5.9!  Its quad-core i7 processor scores 7.6 and the AMD graphics scores a 7.  Its hardware is comparable to a $3000 Windows gaming laptop, but it gets twice the battery life!  I have also purchased a 1TB external hard drive from Seagate that has FireWire 800, USB 3, and eSATA support.  They have promised in the future that they will make a Thunderbolt connector for it, so it will work even faster on this laptop.Other great features of the new MBP are 4GB of DDR3 RAM, an HD webcam built-in, backlit keyboard, and its SDXC card slot.  As a photographer, I am much happier to have an SD slot instead of the ExpressCard slot on my old MBP.  I was originally going to wait this summer for the new MacBook Air, but I am very glad I purchased the Pro instead.  Yes, it is heavier and thicker, but 10 times as powerful and has a better screen!Some people complain about these being "too expensive for what they are" or "just made for Apple fanboys" but the truth is neither statement is correct.  They are just the most reliable and well-built laptops on the planet, and run very fast and long on one battery charge.  Things like a lack of BluRay or USB 3 are not really a big deal, given that Thunderbolt will be 10 times faster than USB 3 and BluRay is not really necessary when you can easily download high-def movies or use Netflix.  If really obsessed with BluRay, just get a slim external drive and use Windows on Boot Camp.  MacOS X Lion is currently the best operating system in production, with tons of features but very easy to learn everything on.  iPhoto, Mail, and Safari are excellent programs for daily use - very simple yet feature-filled, and now can be full-screen.I highly recommend this computer to anyone who wants a fast, powerful, and long-lasting laptop.  Unlike almost all other companies, Apple products retain value a lot better, as they tend to last longer and are much more reliable.  I sold my previous MBP quickly, for about half of what I paid for it 3 years ago, something rarely seen when selling older computers.  My suggestion would be to buy this computer, customize it with a high-res screen if you always work with photos or videos, and buy Windows 7 OEM if needed.  Windows OEM is much cheaper than the full version and it is made for installing to new computers - $129 for Windows 7 Pro compared to $299 for the full version.  The only slight issue with Windows is that unlike in MacOS, the system will not automatically switch graphics cards to save battery.  Therefore, in Windows it is always on the high-power graphics and battery life drops from 7 hours to about 4-5, which is still better than battery on 99% of high-power Windows laptops.As someone who has owned 10 or 12 PCs, 3 Macs, and worked on 6-core brand-new servers, I am just amazed at the speed and power of this new MacBook!  Much better rated than any other computer I have ever used, and even open to higher speed given that I chose to stick with the 2.2Ghz i7 instead of paying $300 more for the 2.3Ghz.  Also, 8GB of RAM is an option, as well as up to 512GB SSDs, which would offer much better data read/write than even my 7200RPM normal drive.  If you are looking for a new, fast, reliable, powerful laptop, look no further.  You've found it!
+	My son love it did everything it said. Was fast to set and now he can play his games and  mindcraft.Great price well worth it he loves the camera. And even my 14 year uses it and says he wants one. Shipped faster than what it said and was packed very good.
+	I like this Macbook pro, which is for my girl friend. Safe metal case, good OS, beautiful design. By the way, I bought when it was $1050.  I am pretty satisfied about its price and quality. It's worthy.
+	Bought this for my son, his first new computer that's all his. He's in love! It has a huge screen and is very fast. Satisfied!!
-	This ultrabook is beautful, but is a garbage. In a week trying to use I put my on the trash. I bought mine on Amazon web site and receive it by Adorama. I open the box and the UB never turn on, only the fan and some backlightletters on the keyboard turn on. All other thinghs never worked, the screen never worked, only black all the time. A friend bought it for me and bring to me in Brazil. I called Asus USA and they told me to call Asus. I call Asus Brasil and the attendant told me Asus Brasil are not allowed by Asus to fix the notebook. And more. All the Asus notebooks sold direct by authorized dealers in Brasil never will be fixed after the warranty expires.  Chame on you Asus, you guys from Asus are a gang...... Never buy Asus.
-	After owning this computer for 6 months, it crashed and would not boot. I fortunately had purchased an extended warranty and Dell sent a technician (160 mi round trip) to replace the motherboard. The computer worked fine for 2 days then crashed again. Dell again sent a technician who again replaced the motherboard. Shortly after, the keyboard stopped working, so for the third time Dell is sending a technician to make a Band Aid fix to this lemon. In total, I have been required to use 12 hours vacation time and have spent no less than 5 hours on the phone with Dell technicians. I would recommend a Commodore 64 over this POS.
-	Amazon is awesome! sony is not. My hard drive crashed two months after i bought the computer and i've been trying to get it fixed for the last four month... it's under sony warranty. still haven't got my computer back and i have to be the one who calls to see if it's fixed yet. will never buy another sony, i'll stick with an apple or a hp.
-	I am a court reporter and I use this computer for work. When it works. It has crashed on me 3 times in 1 year at no fault of my own. No viruses. Just a "bad" hard drive. They replaced it. It crashed again. I have had nothing but problems with this computer. The warranty has covered everything. But what happens when I have problems after the warranty runs out? And who is gonna pay my wages when I'm out of work while it's fixed? Now I'm havIng problems with the mouse pad not responding. I am very careful with this machine. It goes in a hard case inside a hard case inside a hard case anytime I transport it. I don't Download anything that would cause any problems. This has been an absolute nightmare. Don't buy this computer for any serious type of work that you can't afford to lose. Thank god for carbonite. Sony should stick to radios and televisions. This computer SUCKS!!!! An a year later still havin problems, I have a right to say that.
-	I gave this product all 1's because I never even got to have it. I ordered my Yoga a month ago. There were billing issues (on Lenovo's side) and then last week I was called to be told that they were no longer carrying the parts for my order and would I like this instead? I actually ended up upgrading with the promise that my laptop would ship today (2/11/13 - almost 1 month exactly from my initial order). When I went to check my order status though, it said estimated ship date 5/20/13! Why, after waiting a month would I want to wait 3 MORE MONTHS to get my highly anticipated product?!?! By that time, they probably would have ran out of other parts and I most certainly wouldn't have been getting the shiny new innovative product I had been looking forward to. Anyone who loves computers knows the newest thing is out of date almost instantly.So I cancelled my order. Guess what? I had been given some "freebies" to placate me when they had to change my order the first time. They're no longer "free". They shipped before my laptop (obviously) and now I need to return them or be charged the full amount for things I didn't even want, order or ask for in the first place.The worst part is, I'm just so dissapointed. I heard great things about Lenovo. They're products and customer service and I received neither.So if you're thinking about getting a Yoga, and you don't want to wait 1-4 months for your product, don't do it. Go some other route. There's other, really sleek, convertible laptops out there. Asus, Sony or Dell. Companies that won't jerk you around saying you'll get your laptop next week... oh wait, nope, 3 months from now!And, of yeah, Lenovo, I'm going to post this review anywhere I can.
-	From the start it did not work good with usb 3 devices,  constant disconnection etcTHe sound just dissapeared sometimes I had to restart the laptop to get it backthey told me to upgrade bios, it was dead after I did itI bought it in Europe so they dont have service for MSI in every city. Only in POLAND they have service for MSI so you need to wait like 60 days that laptop comes back, which is unheard of.I am still waiting for my laptop to come back after 40 days from service.Also the space button was stuck sometimes, not smoothInbuild microphone is useless for skype, people complained not understanding meThis is the worse laptop I ever had on my life, I use to have HP laptops but the last one overheat, but that was the only problemI would recommend not buying this, the service in Europe is like prehistoric, they told me it will take up to 60 days for repair!!!!Probably when the laptop will come back it will still not work properly, probably they will just fix the biosVery disatisfied with MSI and will not be buying their products anymore
-	First off, I've owned this laptop for 15 months, and it is a nice looking laptop, is fast, and offers plenty of space (640GB). There is another review here about the tempremental touchpad - I agree 100%. My primary complaint is with Samsung, and with it's so called warranty. Six months after the purchase, my laptop got to the point where it needed to be plugged in 100% of the time. I would, at most, have 10 minutes of un-tethered laptop use. I called Samsung, thinking that it was a battery problem and asked for the battery to be replaced. I was told that this was not covered under warranty (which came as a shock to me), and they ran me through a diagnostic battery check with maybe added 10 minutes to my unplugged use, so the call to Samsung was useless. Battery life consistently got worse, so I decided to bite the bullet and just get a new battery. I had previously owned a Dell, so I thought popping in a new battery would be an easy and productive fix. Which brings me to the next topic - it's an internal battery - YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE BATTERY YOURSELF!!! Batteries plus can't do it either. Best Buy (where I bought the laptop) told me a new battery would run $120-$200 to change the battery, $100 or so for the battery, plus another $80-$100 to have someone "install" it. I paid over $800 for this laptop, and I think that A) Samsung should cover batteries under their warranties, and B) I should not be had this problem with a 6 month old laptop, and C) I should be able to change the battery myself.  After this experience, I will not purchase a laptop with an internal battery, it's a deal-breaker.
+	The screen is gorgeous.  It doesn't feel like I am working on a screen that is only 13".  And such a great keyboard.  The best keyboard I have ever had on a laptop.  I've wanted to make the switch to Mac for several years.  (Always had a fondness for Apple ever since I had a Apple IIc.)  But the price always kept me on Windows.  Back in December, I finally made the switch and I am so glad I did.  I really see why people who have Macs love them.  It is worth making the move.
-	My opinion is that this computer does not have the power to run windows8.  Basic surfing in chrome or firefox is rough.  The computer locks up on sites that use any kind programing.  Even a well programed site like facebook will lock up.  So the basic low down is this computer sucks.  You can't watch video even.  Not sure why they put an HDMI port on it I guess that is good if you want a larger screen. The battery life is also short. I had a toshiba netbook before this that was great it had almost similar specs so when I found this one was still being made I excited.  Usually gateway is decent.  I suspect the problem is that specs from 2 years ago just don't cut it anymore as software becomes more advanced. I want to go on about how bad this product is. I wish I just got a tablet and a keyboard.  Now I'm looking into switching to apple.
+	I bought this computer used from Amazon in the later part of 2012.  I should say that in general this computer is great and it's pretty fast - even though mine has only 4gigs of RAM (3 gigs for OSX and 1 gig for Windows 8 on parallel).  I should say that I recommend that if you are planning on spending this kind of money on an Apple product, getting Applecare should be a priority - when I bought the computer, my SD card wasn't working.  I just took it into an Apple Store and the price of repair without warranty would have been $310, with Applecare it was $0.  The premium for a computer with Applecare has already paid off.
-	havent even had this thing for more then like 2 weeks and the brightness on it is shot i can now longer raise or lower the brightness of my screen
-	Tardo demasiado en ser enviado, llego en mal estado (sucia, raspaduras), la laptop no trae el disco duro, ademas no trajo ni el adaptador para cargar la batería de la lap, no trajo ningún accesorio solo la laptop, no viene con windows 7, ella usa es XP, no concuerda con la descripción del productor que el vendedor coloca, ademas que tuve que pagar servicio técnico para acomodar detalles técnicos no solo en cuanto a la ausencia del hard drive si no también de problemas con el software... mi recomendación es que no se si a todos los compradores les paso lo mismo pero tomen en cuenta mi caso y que ya están advertidos... It takes too long to be sent, arrived in poor condition (dirty, scratches), the laptop does not bring the hard disk, also brought neither the adapter to charge the battery of the lap, brought no laptop accessory only, does not come with windows 7 she uses XP is not consistent with the description that the seller placed producer, plus I had to pay for service to accommodate not only technical details regarding the absence of the hard drive but also problems with the software .. . my recommendation is that if not all buyers the same thing happened but take my case into consideration and have been warned ...
+	This was bought as a starter laptop to introduce person to a computer. Works great for it, not too complicated with a bunch of hot keys.Main functions are what we wanted to teach, and they are there. Basic computer
+	My new MacBook Pro 15" (feb 2011) arrived in perfect condition in a sealed box. It works beautifully! Understated elegance with lots of power.
+	Short and sweet: You really do get what you pay for, especially with computers. The customer support is in North America and you can take it to a Genius Bar with questions. Sandy Bridge processor is a quad-core monster (8 with HT) that only gets better with an 8GB RAM upgrade--it makes iMovie cook 1080p video in nothing flat. I've had my MBP for several weeks, it it's a screamer with iMovie videos.Lion Upgrade: I bought mine a few weeks before Lion was released so I was able to get the free upgrade. The upgrade went very smoothly, took approximately 30 minutes (not including download time).Three things I love....a) Everything works as it should, boots quickly, and has killer battery life. (Free upgrade to Lion was a nice touch)b) Fit and finish is top-notch. The display has the best contrast I've seen yet. Sound quality blows away the "Beats Audio" I had on my DV7.c) Relatively cool to the touch. Will warm up under heavy load. Not suitable for using on your lap, get a coolpad or put it on a table.Three things that are neither here nor there....a) Thunderbolt port. No major accessories on the market yet. 10Gbps up/down is nice to have as future-proofing.b) Unibody construction, very few things to take apart. 10 screws to remove the bottom and upgrade the RAM. Built like a Swiss watch inside.c) Backlit keyboard is a nice touch. I generally turn it off but it's handy when you're in a dark room.Things that I didn't like....a) Apple only supports Windows 7 for Boot Camp on this machine. I realize XP is now out of date but I still use it for some things. VMWare Fusion 3 runs it fine, though.b) USB ports are only on one side.c) SD card slot only. Sucks for those of us who use MemoryStick or MSP.
+	I have had this laptop for 4 months now and it's absolutely amazing! This workstation can easily compare to $900 laptops from other manufacturers!Pros: Intel core i5 (middle of the road, but hard to see in inexpensive laptops still), Graphics card, 6gb RAM, 750gb storage, boots in a reasonable amount of time.Cons: Battery life, need to update wi-fi drivers out of the boxAs mentioned before the wi-fi issue can get pretty annoying but once you update the drivers it works like a champ. Do not expect to get 5 hours out of the battery life, but for the boot speed and the performance I'm getting, it's a sacrifice worth taking.*would recommend a ssd for even faster boot times!
-	So I posted this on Lenovo's page after my experience with their on-site tech today. I'm going to just keep posting this everywhere I can find.Lenovo; For Those Who Don't:January 23rd I received the IdeaPad Y510p from Lenovo, and it ran like a dream for 13 days, then I go to take my dog outside and put my laptop in sleep mode and come back in and it won't turn back on. I called in and had the option to return/refund it or repair it. I went with repair in hopes of being able to keep my data and awaited the box that tech support said I would be receiving in 3-5 days...It's the motherboard that needs replaced; power light turns on but the fans, hard drive, keyboard lights, screen, and even USB power are unresponsive. A $1,649 paperweight.20 days later I call back, having been busy with two jobs in Advertising, furious. I found out that it was never sent out and that it was just kind of forgot about. So you kindly "escalated" the repair to an on-site request after you said it would take almost twenty days for a repair and I would still have to wait, that you thought I was sending it in a second time for a second repair, and that you said I couldn't refund it until I told you I talked to a Sales Manager and they said I could and you looked into my history and found I actually did talk to someone and I could due to the situation.Well that on-site guy THAT YOU SENT OUT came today and broke the laptop even more. He lost one screw when taking it apart, forgot to put two screws back in, broke the bottom latch/lock for the laptop, part of the frame (a little plastic clip on the inside but it looks warped now) and was banging the laptop, jabbing it with his plastic tool, and kept saying "I sure hope I don't broke it, don't wanna do that!" I took pictures and cringed the whole time. I about had a stroke watching this guy "try and not break" my laptop. AND IT'S STILL NOT FIXED. It's just been sitting on my desk since I got it.This is a work laptop.I not only make money on this laptop, I spend money on it monthly for my software.I make $18 an hour at the job I got this for, and it has cut back my time there drastically. I can't work there I can only work from home. I was averaging about 3-5 hours a day until the laptop broke. Now I get less because my home computer isn't meant for this work.The software is $20 a month that I can't use.My freelance pays $30-$60 an hour just for design fees.I've lost more money because of this laptop possibly than for what it's even worth.You better get back to me soon.You have my case number.You have my name, phone number, and email.If Lenovo is for "Those Who Do" then what you need to DO is start making up for what you DON'T DO.So do something right for once and call me.This laptop has not only cost me time and money, but now it's cost me my patience.
-	Can't type with the keyboard due to repeated character issue. Touchpad ok not great. Nice design thought. Can't believe the keyboard is that bad. Great amazon.com customer service.
-	Got this laptop for my daughter who is in college. 1st one took back and exchanged August 2010 because it stopped working within 1 month.  The replacement stopped after 2 months & couldn't take back to store. Called Customer Service in October 2010. After lots of phone calls, it is December 2010 and the computer has not been repaired nor replaced... no one from SONY has looked at the computer and it is still completely non-functional.They kept telling my daughter that the part (they've never looked at the computer to see what was wrong with it) is back ordered and that they would call within 2-3 days every time she called (which was almost weekly).  The parts never came in AND they never called.  Finally, they scheduled an appointment on December 23rd to come out and repair it... You guessed it, no call...no show!!!!I spent 2 hours on the phone with SONY December 27th. They finally said that they'd send a box in to expedite a repair (after putting us off for 3 months now they want to hurry it along all of a sudden!!!!)If you're considering this computer... don't. Get a Dell Studio. Mine is 2 years old and I haven't had a single problem with it.I personally will never buy a Sony product again, products are sub-par and customer service is simply non-existent.Three months of lies is more than enough for anyone.
-	This is going back on Monday!I'm a geek, the first thing i do with a new electronic is smell the packaging while unboxing, this laptop had no new smell at all, so i got suspicious. I looked closely at the keyboard before I even plugged it in, hummm no finger oils that i could tell of, the protective cover around the board did have small debris like dust or something, i found this odd. Looking closer I found that  the feet of the laptop had dust on them, thats odd. How nasty was the place this got put together in? I gave benefit of the doubt and started the activation process. I left the battery where it was since i might have been returning it if it booted up with someones info on it already or something. It turned on, so pretty is the keyboard! Hate windows 8, but such is the way of the world. First thing I did was go to YouTube to try out it's video playback. My internet speed is 50 Mbps, so buffering it NOT an issue. Ummm Why is this thing having issues with playback of YouTube? Why is Lady GaGa Pausing and Stuttering. Even better What the *F* is wrong with this track Pad?It only has 1 square inch of usable space in the center of the pad. Leave that area and it stops responding and brings up right click options.I got it to be used as a power house desktop anyway, plugged in my mouse and keyboard newly arrived and fresh out the box from Amazon the same time, feeling better about my laptop now. Hummmm, why did this go to sleep while i was in the bathroom? It didn't, now it will not turn on. At this point i decide to look at the unopened battery.......Well well Well I see a good bit of DIRT on the foot that the laptop battery makes contact on surfaces with.A good job was done cleaning this up, someone forgot to clean off the battery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Back on Monday I say.
-	[Redacted]Edit:After close to a year of ownership the screen randomly took on a single dead pixel. I set it down for the night and two days later I opened it to see about a hundred dead pixels across the screen. I sent it in for warranty repair where it sat for two weeks with no status update. Finally after a phone call I was told it was "customer induced damage" and would not be covered. Please note, there was no customer induced damage the worst damage the computer had was a smudged screen from fingerprints.I am a former Asus employee at their Jeffersonville repair facility where I worked on this exact laptop among others for refurbish support (most of what that facility does is component support). This wasn't customer induced damage this was "we don't want to fix it because it's too hard and expensive so we'll blame the customer."Asus is dead to me now.
+	I had been skeptical of buying a Mac for years, mostly because I felt they were overpriced.  To some extent, I still feel they are a little too pricey, but I can't say enough about how happy I am with the MBP thus far.  I thought it might take a while to get acclimated to the different OS, having used Windows for years.  It has been a pretty easy transition.  OSX is intuitive, snappy and fun to use.  Having an iPhone and syncing with iTunes is so much easier than using iTunes on a Windows machine.I have been using both Vista (awful OS) and Windows 7 (very good OS).  I can't say I miss those days.  I hope the MBP holds up better over time than my previous Windows machines.  In speaking with friends, they notice no significant slowdowns in their MBP even a few years later.  This is my pet peeve with Windows machines.  No matter how well you maintain them, they slow to a crawl...and iTunes becomes unusable.I can't wait until Mountain Lion comes out, and I get to use some of the iOS applications that are optimized for OSX.
-	This Laptop doesn't work. It just freezes after couple of minutes working. According to Amazon policy it couldn't be returned to the seller.
+	The product largely does what it's expected to do: CPU is fast, integrated graphic chip is good for non-gaming applications, and touch-enabled screen goes well with Windows 8 Metro interface. Out of the box, wifi indeed is not stable (obvious compared with other devices connected to the same network: changing to "limited" connection and then coming back after some time). Installing the latest driver from Acer's support website has solved the wifi problem, but the bluetooth no longer works. Since I use wifi all the time while seldom connecting to a bluetooth device, it seems to be worthwhile trade-off for now. Hopefully Acer can introduce a patch that can make both wifi and bluetooth reliable.
-	I bought this laptop few months ago,and i think it was the worst decision that i had in my life,the screen get cracked spontaneously, and Sony refused to repair it.they have the worst customer service.i am not gonna buy any Sony product again.
-	I used to buy Asus productsd all the time. I recently bought a Zenbook. Great computer, until the power socket went bad. It took two weeks for them to get back to me with an RMA number. Had to pay for shipping, then the service center sent me an email saying they wanted me to pay for shipping back. Got it back, but had other problems.  6 weeks later, I have been able to use it for less than two of them. Their only answer is "Call and get an RMA and send it back for repair. They won't refund or replace it or send me a temporary to use.I will never buy Asus again.
-	I purchased this computer from a mac store near my house. I bought a thin shell for it and a thick outer case. I also purchased keyboard and screen protector - so i'm never actually touching the machine when in use. I take very good care of my notebook. I sometimes pick up this notebook to move it - in example I sometimes use it before bed and set it on my bedside dresser before going to sleep. One morning - I woke up and started my computer to find that the screen had cracked in the location I had (gently) picked it up to move it. I am incredibility disappointed with the fragility of this product because when I went to the mac store to have it repair they said it would cost $656.00 for parts and labor. Additionally they charged me $59.00 for diagnostic fees and found that the damage was the result of "negligent use."This is the most expensive computer of this size/technical features on the market... it is also the most fragile... it is also the most costly to repair/replace. My machine broke 15months after purchasing it new in store. The cost to repair it was double what I paid for the computer that I got to replace it. I want to support this company because I love their products/designs but there are more and more products on the market that are just as good, more durable, and far less expensive. My experience with this computer inspired me to no longer bring my business to Mac.
+	I custom-ordered from the Lenovo/Thinkpad site.  My configuration:Thinkpad X230 Tablet+ Core i7 2.90 GHz Ivy Bridge processor+ 8 GM RAM+ 128 GB Solid-State Drive+ 1366x768 Matte Multi-Touch Screen with Active Stylus+ 9-cell extended battery (sticks out the back and adds a bulge at the bottom; the 6-cell battery just sticks out the back)+ Windows 7 Pro+ Ultra-Base 3 with DVD/RW optical drive- No discrete graphics card optionI've been a long-time Thinkpad fan--including 600E (late 1990s), R40 (early 2000s), T42 (mid 2000s), T420 (late 2000s)--for the rock-solid dependability, non-nonsense styling, and in particular the king-of-them-all keyboard. I mistakely tried a Dell Latitude E6400 for a couple of years, and I truly hated it, despite its own pointer stick and solid construction. When I decided to get this X230 Tablet, the only thing I was worried about was how the new keyboard was going to feel. Well, have no fear. I am a big fan of the new keyboard. It's got deep travel, its motion is the perfect blend between smooth travel and pleasing resistance, and the contoured surface actually feels comforable. This new keyboard is a winner. Other than that, there really isn't anything that needs to be said about this machine that the prospective buyer wouldn't already know. I loaded it up to the gills with the fastest and best of everything, except a 3G cellular card--totalled over $3000 MSRP before a the Ultrabase 3 and extra power adapters. On paper, the only thing the X230T lacks is discrete graphics, but the Intel HD 4000 integrated graphics that comes with the Ivy Bridge chipset is good enough for my occasional Engineering analysis and 3D modeling work--just make sure to get a least 8 GB RAM to share with the inegrated graphics. Plus, the Ultrabase 3 is able to support dual monitors via its dual VGA+DisplayPort ports. Just one final tip--get the Multitouch screen; you'll be ready for Windows 8 Pro when it's released.2012-11-24 UPDATE: I installed Windows 8 Pro upgrade on this computer the week Windows 8 was released.  On the first boot-up, everything worked.  I the installed all the Lenovo-provided Windows 8 drivers for this machine, and everything continued to work fine.  Windows 8 works very well on this machine, as if it was designed for it.
-	This year I bought a lenovo computer using your services and it came with the hard drive damage. I had to fix it twice in less than a year. The international waranty I paid doesn't work, they take more than a  month to fix it and they make you do everything. My experience with lenovo have been terrible, it's not a quality device.
+	Got this PC in 2009 for school. I recently upgraded to a desktop, because my latitude E5400 was full of photos, and documents.My new PC is much faster, and has windows 8.1. I prefer the latitude as a workstation, because it's still a great computer.
-	I usually don't write reviews but I feel I have to on this one. I would give this thing 0 Stars if I could. I bought this trash two months ago from Best Buy with the intention of using it to type papers and browse the web.Pros  - Good Screen Size and Quality  - Thin for a cheap computerCons  - Gets dirty easily  - Space bar will only work half the time  - Track pad can be very unresponsive  - Wireless Connectivity is awfulAfter two months of using this thing, I got the blue screen of death and I sent it into the shop to get it fixed under warranty. I am going to practically give this to someone on eBay just to get it off my hands and I'm buying a Mac because I know I can trust those.
+	I hope to be the first of many MAC. Spectacular. Neither compares to a PC, simply beautiful.At the touch, the aluminum appears velvet. Battery lasts longer than 4 hours. Although more expensive, is much faster than a PC in the same configuration.
-	This laptop has the goods to be one of the best out there but unfortunately a HUGE known issue is with the intel wireless card. Simply does not work properly and there is no fix at this time.Do not purchase this laptop without doing your research.
+	I just purchased this laptop and so far so good. The design is nice and I like the keyboard layout. Windows 8 is already programmed on the laptop and it's a little difficult to use, but with time I'm sure it won't be an issue. The only thing that I don't like about the laptop is the location of the speakers. The speakers are on the bottom of the laptop, so whenever I play music the sound is muffled. That being said, it's not that hard to prop it up on something. In the end, while I really do like the laptop, the location of the speakers and the fact that I have to use Windows 8 prevent me from giving this laptop 5 stars.
-	This laptop is total crap. I wouldn't have even given it 1 star! I think I had it for 3 months before the hard drive died taking all of my files with it. Luckily I still had a warranty so they replaced it for me after a few hours on the phone and them making me try a bunch of stupid things that didn't work. Then shortly after that my memory gave out. When I called there they told me to reseat the memory. I did, and the laptop turned back on. I didn't realize that one of the memory chips had burned out completely and it was only running on 1 GB. I should have had 3GB. I didn't realize it until after my warranty was up.  They outsourced their customer service to India. Try getting them to understand anything you are saying. Its like talking to a box of rocks. I'm not a computer genius but even I knew what the problem was. I argued on the phone with him for hours. They are useless. I will never buy another Dell nor would I recommend it to anyone. Which is a shame because I have owned 3 Dell computers and they were all reliable. I think they are losing more and more customers with every computer they send out.
+	I too had this issue. To fix it remove all the screws on the back except for the ones along the hinge area of the LCD. Next remove the keyboard, there are little clips at the top that hold it on, then remove the top panel of the case (there are thee cables that attach, the speaker the touchpad and one other, this need to be disconnected). unscrew the screws holding the heatsink on and remove the heatsink. Turn the locking screw and remove the processor. Using a heat gun at around 300 degrees make little circles for two to three minutes over the two chips to the left of the processor. let everything cool and put everything back together. The laptop should now work.
-	It says newest version but i got mid 2012 macbook air.. be sure to confirm the model before buying it. I am returning the laptop. You can get the latest model from apple store though its $ 50 bucks more..
-	Just after some days the letter s of the keyboard is broken. How shoul I proceed to repair it?IT is not aceptable,
-	It's solid, sturdy and powerful. Keyboard is well put together, the chassis allows one to easily make repairs and upgrades. While the memory and hard drive could be better the threaded quad-core is the reason to buy this laptop. If you work with cpu intensive applications this will shame anything in the atom class, if that is a "class".If you want really great performance you'll need to upgrade the memory and replace the hard drive with an ssd. There are only three screws in the way of doing that, it does seem well-built, and the board takes upgrades well, with a little work you can get better than ultrabook for under a grand.However, and this is five stars of however (like other sites Amazon won't let me leave a zero), when you remove the battery to upgrade the memory or ssd Lenovo will begin spitting bios and Windows errors that it doesn't support non-Lenovo parts, and you're using a non-Lenovo battery. This is an issue for me as I usually leave my laptop on a kvm switch under the desk and I don't like having to go down there and deal with it every time windows feels the need to error reboot.It's the same battery you fools, I only pulled it to upgrade your known weaknesses. Lenovo must issue a bios update to settle this issue.Like most tech companies Lenovo doesn't know if they deal in hard or soft-- ware. They have great hardware here, but their software is far below zero.

+	My new MacBook Pro 15" (feb 2011) arrived in perfect condition in a sealed box. It works beautifully! Understated elegance with lots of power.
+	I have been a PC user all my life, but when it came to looking at new laptops, none really compared to the MacBook Pro. The 13.3 inch version is perfect for travelling with as it is tiny and very light weight. It is durable enough that I'm not concerned about it bouncing around in the bag, as I would be with some of the new ultrabooks. The downside to this is that the battery life says it is around 7 hours, and mine is fairly low after 4 hours, but that is also using it for 4 hours straight. For those users switching from PC, it is very easy to get the hang of the Mac. I will most likely continue to purchase Mac now.
+	I'm very happy with the laptop and with the seller!  We bought this laptop to use out in the garage, about 300 feet or so from the house so we could look for and order parts for repair projects we're working on.  We didn't want to keep running back to the house to do that.  The laptop picks up the wireless network broadcasting from inside the house very well, and we cruise the parts stores all day long without any problems at all.
-	Latest software and all patches and here we are -- started to shut off unexpectedly (first in Skype), more and more frequently to the point of being unusable. Will be repaired under warranty (we'll see...), but still, this apple was rotten.
+	I have had the Asus G75V for nearly a year now. Very quick unit and very reliable. The only down side, and this is a big one, is the piece of crap touch pad that they use. It it total junk. The cursor jumps all over the place and selects things that you don't want to select. It does this even with the sensitivity turned way down. Using an external mouse is somewhat better but it is still annoying. Other than that I would highly recommend this unit.
+	I bought this MacBook Pro 13.3' Laptop computer because I wanted a lightweight, smaller computer to use in our living room.  Thinking the smaller screen might present a problem seeing it well, I was surprised that the glossy screen could be seen easily.  Such vivid colors, too!  I am a senior citizen, and have not had any trouble reading what is on the screen.  While I watch TV, I can check my e-mails and answer them, surf the net and check various files that I have.  I also like to play games.  I can also listen to music (CDs or online) and streaming radio broadcasts (our son broadcasts from out-of-state and love being able to hear his radio station's streaming).  Being a Mac-only user, I wanted a very good, well-made, reliable computer with plenty of functions such as a DVD player---and this is it!  And, it only weighs 4.5 lbs., so is easy to place onto a table that I have near my chair when I am finished using it.  It is a great size for travel, too.  I own a larger, older Mac Book Pro, too, and have never been disappointed with it.  I highly recommend this computer.
-	I had problems with my new computer,  not start correctly, this problem is recurrent,  I would not recommend this product
+	This is a great laptop, only downside is only apple could sell you a $2,000 plus laptop and onlysupply 4gb of ram standard.
-	It is bulky and heavy  for a laptop in this age of tablets.  I did not like the look or feel.  I wish I had returned it.
-	Please do yourself a favor and stay far away from this model, and any HP model for that matter.  This computer will freeze up, will reset itself, will shut itself down, will not boot up, etc.  This model laptop is also strictly configured for the use of Windows 8 ONLY, regardless of enabling features for Windows 7 capability or other operating systems within the bios.  Windows 8 has many buggy issues that are just slightly less problematic than Windows Vista was, hence the introduction to Windows 8.1 to be released this October.  Yes, Windows must take some of this blame as well here.  The laptop is extremely weak in benchmark scores, and has generic hardware that is faulty, such as the Hitachi hard drive, and questionable motherboard.  If you bought one and you're within the time frame for a full refund, by all means, RETURN IT.  I explained this to a potential buyer now sucker, that knows I work with computers, and they did not take my advice.  (Couldn't beat that price)  The computer cannot be returned to Best Buy because of their "we only sell junk and offer 15 day return policies to ultimately steal our customer's money."
-	I was really excited to buy this laptop because I needed a small laptop to bring to lectures.  The size is perfect, however, the performance of this laptop was VERY slow and laggy!  I was also surprised at how much it overheated.  Needless to say, I was not very impressed with this laptop and it will be returned.
-	The keyboard dock disconnects too often. It's too silly to design such a product like this. This should be very basic thing. Don't think I would buy any Samsung laptop/tablet again.And the other issue, the Win8 system sleep function doesn't work well too. Last night had I put it into sleep with 100% battery, and tonight I tried to turn it on -- it doesn't work since all the battery power is out. Can you imagine that? Even my 15' Acer 5740DG wouldn't lose too much power while sleeping.Disappointed for both hardware and software.
-	I bought this item within HOURS of it becoming available on Amazon.  That's hours after the US release, while it was an "Amazon exclusive."  I got next day shipping so I could take it on a trip with me in a few days.I was so disappointed to turn it on and find out that the WiFi did not work.  Yes, it was enabled.  Yes I typed the network password in correctly.  Yes, I tested the access point with other devices, and it was good.  But nothing helped this poor Zenbook.  The thing just could not get packets in or out of its wifi card.Other than that it's a nice laptop.  The screen sure is incredible.  I might try the UX32VD one of these days, but I'll wait for that until a few more people have had a chance to review it.Buyer beware!
-	So I bought this notebook because of the price,  decent reviews and because it came with Microsoft Office. Did the custom install as recommended.  After using computer for an hour or so I suddenly had a split screen I couldn't get rid of. Finally did a factory reset which corrupted office. So go to Microsoft and they tried but couldn't fix it. Tell me to.get in touch with HP. That tech tries to download the trial version of Office. I tell him I have product key and it is a full version. He insists this is impossible, computer came with trial. Tired of arguing with him. Call Amazon ...they are great will take computer back and offer to replace. Taking the refund. No more HP computers for me, because customer service is so awful. Computer itself slow despite custom set up.
+	This is the first Mac that I have owned.  I also own an iPhone 4 and an iPad (first generation).  I love this product.  Two days ago, I updated to Lion, free of charge, since I bought this MacBook Pro from Amazon after June 6, 2011.  It is great for surfing the web, work, watching movies, everything!  I am an attorney, and formatting of Word documents is critically important to me.  I installed Mac Office 2011 on my MacBook Pro.  It works fabulously.  No formatting errors with my PC friends at work when working on Word docs on my Mac.  Buy this Mac, you won't go back!
-	It crashed for no real reason just two months past the warranty!!!!! Will never buy another apple laptop in this lifetime especially because it was over $1000 and one would expect it to last longer than that... My Gateway ($600) is about 5yrs old and is still going strong...
-	We received this new purchase today and fully read User's Manual before turning it on, charged it for 3 hours, as stated in instructions.  Machine has completely failed to turn on, absolutely NO screen activity, drive indicator flashes for a minute then completely turns off.  Called ASUS technical support and they walked me though process to try to start and we were not successfu.  Returning this product to Amazon tomorrow!Dec 10, 2013This should count as a separate review on the same model, but Amazon won't allow it.  I've exchanged first non-working laptop I initially received with exact same model and I had the exact same issue - screen would not turn on.  This time I asked the IT helpdesk manager at my company to look at it.  He connected laptop to external monitor and updated operating system and drivers without success.  The laptop functions but screen does failed to turn on. This time, I am exchanging for different maker.
+	The delivery is fast and pack is in good condition.I love Mac pro as soon as I got it and started to use it.
+	Mac was great, brand new , without any damage!The delivery was fast!I`m very satisfied with my purchase!I highly recommend it!
+	I had an old Dell that I purchased in 2007. This product is far better and the touch screen works well.
-	The computer is ok, in fact pretty good I would say.My issue is the customer service.The customer service people, if you ever get to the right department are- lacking in information. They do not even know what products they sell.- lacking in knowledge of who to put you through tooWe purchased Micosoft office from Lenovo, we also added on Fix It as suggested by the sales rep. Fix it just crashed the computer and you have no hope of returning it as nobody cares.Windows 8 comes with a anti virus program called Defender but Lenovo have disabled Defender and put Macfee anti virus on the computer. Trying to get MacFee off and turn Defender on by calling support is harder than getting Iran to stop their Nuks program. First they say they do not preinstall MacFee, latter they say they do but to get MacFee off you have to pay them money.Getting any sort of response from customer service is a total joke.If I could send the computer back I would, simply because dealing with Lenovo as a company is just too hard.Oh, they will not but my reviews on their website, only good reviews go up it seems.
+	A few things to get off my chest first.1. Restore discs don't ship with computers any more...they just don't. It's not hard to make the restore discs yourself. DO IT IMMEDIATELY.2. If you don't know how, pay someone.3. No idea what virus program you would have to load as soon as you un-box this laptop, considering it ships installed with Windows Defender active on start up. I don't even know where to begin on the comment that the aforementioned anti virus ruined the OS. What the hell did you install, dude?4. Don't 1 star a laptop that bricked from user error.Now, I've had this laptop for a few weeks now and I love it. The Trinity A-10 4600M processor with discrete class gpu is powerful enough to compete with an i-5 running an Intel hd integrated gpu. I just installed a crucial m4 256gb SSD and upgraded the ram to 16gb, did a clean install of Win8 and this baby screams.
-	My sister bought this for me as a birthday present and because my gaming rigs power supply went up. I use it as a bathroom laptop to read news while I'm in there because trying to do anything else is a pain in the ass. The keyboard is a nightmare and you practically have to punch the keys to get them to register and the space bar oh god dont get me started on how annoying it is to have to constantly smash the damn thing to get it to work at all.This thing sucks all because but the keyboard is worthless and youre better off plugging a mouse into it and using windows onscreen keyboard and clicking 1 letter at a time to type anything.
+	Great notebook.  Extremely fast, quiet, amazing battery life.  The mouse pad is great, and I'm getting used to Windows 8.1.  Please note I only use it for surfing, researching, excel and word.  The outside metal finish gives it a great look. I am definitely glad I purchased this notebook.  One thing I would like to add is that I am not totally sure this is an "ultrabook" as the manufacturer makes no mention of this anywhere.  Nonetheless, great laptop, and actually performs better than the ultrabook I bought for my sister 8 months ago.  I wish I would have bought this laptop months ago.  Not giving it 5 stars because although I love this product, it totally has to blow me away to give it 5 stars.  Great product, and worth the $550.00 I paid for it.
-	I bought this laptop in November. It worked for a couple weeks but out of nowhere a white horizontal line started to appear on screen.  I called the people I bought it from (BestDeal Tech, they suck) but they said I have to call Dell directly.  I did that and Dell sent someone to replace the screen with a "new" one.  Turns out that "new" one was refurbished and had existing damage.  The rep admitted it was damaged and said he would send someone else out to replace it...never happened.  The laptop crashed days later and I've been dealing with Dell support (no thanks to BestDeal Tech) to fix the problem with no solution yet.  BestDeal Tech refuses to help me even though they sold me what I believe was a defective system because of a BS 30-day return policy.  The problems started after 30 days.  I had a Dell Inspiron Notebook for 9 years before I bought this one that lasted about 9 weeks.  Now it's an $800 paperweight.
+	I buy Dell computers to take to Tanzania to colleagues who can only spend $200 and a little more.  Tampa is amazing.  They are responsive and help with any questions.  These Dell 610-620 stand the test of time.  This one had Windows XP professional which I highly recommend even in the days of Windows 8.  It is reasonably fast.  The hard drive may be small, but you can buy back ups and especially for students where no Apple Store is available, they are definitely worth it.  I am an Apple fan, so I gave my Dell up a few years ago, but this one stands the test of time.  (Know your seller)
-	Sorry, I would not recommend the vendor who sent me this model.  It was a knockoff.  The sound was tinny and text was not clear.  Had other problems.  Did not perform like an HP product.  HP could not even help me and then told me they could not find the product code in their system.  I had to return this Amazon.  Very sad.  I am a very loyal Amazon customer and felt badly that I had to return it.  The Amazon Customer Service staff could not be more helpful and courteous.
+	Worked perfect right out of the box.  Could not tell that it was refurbished.  Can't beat the features for the price.but the software was advertisement riddled.  Still getting used to Windows 8 but so far so good.
-	I recently purchased 2 IBM THINkPADS from 2 different private sellers via Amazon.com.  I have already evaluated both purchases.  I do not know who this third one is.
+	I replaced an aging PowerBook G4 that had some memory problems with this beauty, and it has never once -- not ONE time -- let me down.  I had everything backed up on external drives and copying everything over took about 1% of the time backing it up took on the G4.Late last year I put 16GB in this lil baby and she runs like a Ferrari now.  Not that she didn't run fast before, mind you.  I'm wishing I'd gotten the 750GB drive now, but an external iTunes library and a 2TB network storage drive helps keeps things in perspective.  Even with all of the stuff I have on it, I'm only using 75GB.The only reason I have Windows 7 on here is for graduate coursework. the 16GB helps there, too.
-	I can't even connect an external drive to this POS - the USB3 port don't even recognize the drive, and USB2 port is excruciatingly slow. Also, the latest wireless driver (from Windows Updates) crashed the OS on every wake up. I had to roll back the driver version to avoid the crashes. Lenovo's overall quality and level of care is rather low.
-	the LED screen failed in less than a month. it stated with some bright spots on the bottom of the screen. the whole screen went black a week later. I searched on apple.com's forum and apparently that issue wasn't new. it started in 2008 (I bought mine in 2012) and there were dozens of pages about this particular problem. obviously most apple fans have extreme tolerance of apple defects. I was looking for possible solution on the forum but all I found were silly comments like, "it's OK. it happens. bring it to the apple store and they'll exchange it for a new one." problem was, I had a new laptop. I didn't need another new one. I had just spent two weeks installing xcode because instead of letting you download this free programing workbench from a web page, apple forces you to buy it via apple store for free. I never had an itune account and for that reason, I couldn't simply set up my account on the newly purchased MacBook. I was on the phone with the apple genius and her supervisor for hours to no avail. they told me to use my windows laptop to first open an itune account but that didn't work either. they told me to wait for an email or phone the following day. nobody called or emailed and my account still didn't work the following day. then I called them and a few hours later it was working. apple geniuses are polite and often apologize. as a result, you can't really lash out at them. but there're useless. eventually, I didn't bring the laptop to the apple store because I didn't want another laptop, which would require me download xcode again. I brought it to an authorized dealer to have the screen replaced.
+	This is a great laptop!, Came with all the things it promised and is pretty slick. At first it was hard to use for me since Im a recent Mac convert but it has won over me! Make sure to buy a cover for it though because the fragile aluminum cover can get scratches easily.
-	Anyone not being honest is you.....People I wouldn't go through this if it weren't true....This man need to tell the truth he sold me a non working computer, I sent it back and he is lying saying he never received it...I can only warn you guys one time so if you still give this man your business beware...If you do make sure you send it back priority mail so you can have a tracking number to follow it...that's the mistake I made by sending it through regular mail...he can deny and use it against you and say he never received it..That's why I am going through this now but, if you feel you need to steal my money you must really need it!...Just know Karma is real and what goes around comes around!
+	My daughter was very happy with her birthday gift. She has grown up with desktop computer all through high school and now she can not find words to express the joy and wonder. I must admit it's a really pretty nice laptop - very portable, runs super fast, the backlit keyboard makes it easy to type in the dark, the multi touch gestures trackpad are awesome, a pleasure to work on such a high-quality screen. By the way, I was impressed with Amazon price and zero shipping, I recommend it to everyone!
-	I just got this laptop back from the repair shop. Thank God I bought the warranty because the system board and the DVD drive needed replacement. It no longer overheats, but the DVD drive still does not open. The screen is beautiful and the machine is fast. The headaches regarding this laptop are more than you'd like. Do yourself a favor and shop around. I thought Toshiba was top of the line. I still think highly of Toshiba, just not this model. Good luck!
-	Ive owned apple for over 8 years, and I've got to say that the last three computer I have bought from them have been some of the  worse computers I have owned. There quality in the last few years has really took a nose dive. Not just hardware failures, but every operating system has become more bogged down, slow, and so unresponsive. I remember back when I would upgrade to a newer OS with my computer it would actually make it run better. Back in the tiger and panther days. Not just are they double the price of a windows computer, but they seem to have more and more acclimating issues. I won't be purchasing a new computer from apple in the future.
-	If this review has numerous typos, it is because the keyboard on this computer is so shallow it does not register strokes about 40% of the time.  It is literally the worst keyboard I have ever used in my life.  Every key take a pounding to register, if it does at all.  Horrible!!!  Just horrible!
+	I purchased this computer to replace my 5 year old core 2 duo Mac Book Pro. I knew that I would see performance improvements and I have been pleased with how much this new computer is improved over the old one. I upgraded to 8 GB RAM (self installed) and the upgrade is well worth it. RAM hungry programs that I would really never run at the same time (Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Indesign) now happily run along side each other. 3D rendering is much faster. No comparison between the old MBP and this new one for 3d or video encoding - huge improvement.I needed to upgrade and decided to go for the extra horsepower and am happy with my decision. My old MBP was not a unibody. This one feels much more solid and better built.
-	I recently made this purchase via the official Lenovo store due to my old laptop's battery giving out and have had nothing but grief throughout the entire process.First of all, I was deciding between this and the M6400, but decided to go with Lenovo due to talking to a sales agent and getting assurance that it would ship before would. What he failed to mention was the delay that would be caused by customs, and the fact that it also ended up shipping 2 days after the stipulated date that he assured me of. 48 hours is a long time when you have deadlines every day in the actual working world.But that's just overeager sales people, right? So secondly, when I finally checked my order status, I was shocked to discover that the configuration I had listed no RAID whatsoever. I had to look up the product manual to discover that there were some W530 models that actually did not have the RAID mboards in them, and after going back and forth between Lenovo sales/tech phone support (thanks for redirecting me everywhere and not actually answering my question, by the way Lenovo), I ended up getting a solid answer from the user forums: that there ARE no RAID models available at the moment, and not for a few months at least.I'd like to point out that at NO POINT in the ordering process was this mentioned, anywhere. And on the main product page, it mentions that it supports RAID. If not for the fact that I needed it urgently and had no time to go through the process of cancelling the order and going with a instead, I would never have gone through with this purchase.So anyway, I finally get the laptop, set about stripping out all the existing software and going with a fresh install of Win 7. And then I get BSODs whenever the AC is unplugged, which took me yet another 4 hours to diagnose before I discovered that the BIOS wasn't updated. After flashing it, now the ExpressCard slot no longer works (thankfully that's not a critical problem, since it just means I lose one USB port). The customer support tech I contacted had the gall to tell me that I had too much RAM that was causing the problem!Additionally, if you do end up choosing to go with a W530, do yourself a favour, and get the full HD screen (I got the 1600x900 because I hate having screens with anything higher than 90DPI). The lower-end screens have absolutely b ad colour gamut and viewing angles (completely out of whack white point and blue gamma). It's worth mentioning that this is the first ever screen I have actually had to use a colour calibrator to correct gamma, instead of eyeballing it like I usually do. It's that b ad. And I've calibrated Phillips screens before.Build quality, despite what most people think, is actually not-so-good. The keyboard panel sags, the general material used (with the exception of the screen housing, which is actually quite well-built) is crappy plastic all over and the new keyboard rubber dome feel is not as crisp as other manufacturers' (Acer/Asus actually has better feel)Also, the lack of a numpad. I knew I was already going to miss it, but it boggles the mind as to why Lenovo chose this new layout, presumably to fit in larger drivers for the speakers, which are massive. Unfortunately, I think it's a poor compromise (who the hell mixes on laptop speakers anyway?) since the speakers don't sound that good at higher levels, and have b ad response through the mid-range of tones. I always use an external sound card and monitors for my audio, anyway, so it's not a huge issue for me. No Caps Lock/Num Lock indicators, however, which means you have to rely on a OSD display, which takes up RAM and CPU, along with GPU draws to screen. So, pretty annoying.So...the good points. The general aesthetic is actually alright, the matte finish is welcome, and the arrangement of ports (with the exception of zero USB ports on the right side) is alright. The RAM slot positioning and HDD slots are well thought-out, making upgrades accessible and less frustrating (but to be fair, almost every manufacturer has caught onto this these days)In summary, however, with all these problems of reliability, fraudulent sales, and absolutely useless tech support, there is no way I could recommend this to anyone, or any Lenovo product for that matter, considering this is the way a professional product is being marketed and supported. I am terribly disappointed that in a already small market for workstations, Lenovo has chosen to blatantly disregard its offering, I suspect, in favour of its probably more profitable consumer lines.Just remember: we're the ones making the actual entertainment media for those products.
-	Bought it because it was within my budget and seemed to have the basics that i was looking for. This product is NOT worth it. Computer is bulky, feels cheap and canNOT support basic web browsing with out constantly freezing up. Very slow execution of windows 7. Screen is decent buts thats about it. Dont waste your time or money on this one...
+	I have been a Pc user for all my life. I am an art major and I needed something that runs reliably with some of the heavy software that I would be using. I had used a iMac at school to finish up a a project with Photoshop (this was a public computer) and it worked amazingly. The first thing I noticed was the fact that there is only one clicking button, not the left and right click that you would see on a PC. The stability of the OS X 10.7.2 is amazing. I have never used such a quick computer before. The computer comes beautifully packaged and the shape of the laptop is just remarkable. I don't know how they were able to fit such a fine mechanism into such a drastically aesthetic design. It's like Apple thought carefully about ease of use, neutrality in color, while also being fully aware of the software. The finger swipes are addictive. You CANNOT do anyhing like this on a PC that I know of. The trackpad is revolutionary in my mind. It is just one solid gray square made of glass. It feels your fingers swipes and seemlessly manages to switch from window to window, screen to screen. The camera is high quality. There is no random, no-name software in here either. This is one of the main things that really almost brought be to tears. I didn't have to uninstall all the useless junkware. The computer turns on, welcomes you, and prompts a few start up questions. Then you have the desktop. I don't, in any way feel pretentious about having this computer. This IS a very expensive computer, but I know that it is a high quality computer, well worth the price. I spend very little time on forums, trying to figure out how to use it. I don't have to call up the geeks to do the things I want, which is nice. In the long run, I may end up spending less money on repairs. I am fotunate that this device is within my grasp, but the truth is, if I couldn't dish out this kind of money, I would have had to settle for a PC.
-	I have owned 10 IBM computers and this is the first Lenovo I have ever owned. The machine worked well and the software was pretty good; although, some of the preloaded software wasn't that helpful and just used up some of the hard drive space.The screen isn't very good and powerful graphics chip goes to waste with a not so clear screen. The computer is fast, when it works.It only took four months before my hard drive crashed. Lenovo service did a great job of sending out the new hard drive and recovery disks but they couldn't help me restore my machine from my external Western Digital drive. Windows Vista kept on asking for an installation disk and as Windows Vista was pre-installed I didn't have this disk. Eventually, I gave up and paid a local tech to restore my computer for $300.The replacement hard drive lasted about 1 year and then it crashed as well. When I originally purchased the machine, I bought the expensive 5 year on-sight service as well. The extra cost didn't bother me, I have money and NO time to deal with computer crashes.Lenovo apparently reset my warranty period when they sent me the new hard drive, to an absurdly short period of time. As such, my machine was already past its warranty period. I purchased the recovery disks for $60 and bought a Western Digital hard drive from Tiger Direct. There is no way I am paying Lenovo for another substandard hard drive.Any benefits this machine may have, is outweighed by the fact that if the hard drive is dead - you have an expensive door stop and nothing more.This will be my first and last Lenovo laptop.
+	I originally bought a Toshiba 1.4 GHz POS...it was a great laptop if I just wanted to stare at the desktop (it lagged even bringing up the control panel), so I took it back immediately and got this. After finally resolving the aforementioned issues w/the wifi (which dropped every one minute) which I had to download the update for 30 minutes on my desktop PC, burn to PC and install, this thing works perfectly. No wifi problems at all. Very fast w/no drops.As far as performance, I ran multiple programs while looking at the processes tab, I watched it just from about 1 to 2.7GHz continuously. So far it's handled everything w/no lags at all. Touchscreen is good.Two things that are a little annoying are Windows 8 and the touchpad. Windows 8 is just new so you have to learn it, and as far as I can tell, just about all laptops have touchpad issues, so I don't hold it against the laptop or Acer. Price was good, shipped past and packaged well. Happy!
+	This MacBook is great.  I just bought it from Bestbuy and it offers all the best of the previous generation, but it's faster, cooler, and I'm pretty sure the Trackpad performs better (if that'seven possible).  The only way to go is Mac, because the battery life is phenomenal, the screen is vivid, and it's extremely light and portable.  The only thing I don't like is the fact that I bought the 13.3 inch.  It's small, even for a portable.  If you're an avid laptop enthusiast, try to shoot for the 15 inch.  Thanks Apple, RIP Steve Jobs.
-	I bought this for school and since day one all I have had are issues.. blue screens, issues with updates and error messages. thank God for Geek Squad.. but I have had to put in several extra $$$$... will never buy another piece of equipment like this from Amazon.
+	This has been the best computer. I've had it a couple of years and no problems.Would definitely recommend this product!
-	I have an HP laptop at work that I love so I bought one for my personal use.....Well, huge mistake!!!! This is a HP 2000 notebook. It is so slow it is like having dial up again. Also the curser freezes up constantly. Every time I use it, I have to shut the machine down several times because it freezes up. And DESPISE Windows 8! Most aggravating, user unfriendly program I have ever used. I would love to throw this pathetic laptop out the window!!!! Come on HP!!! I KNOW you can do better than this!!!!
+	I have been a Mac user for 24 years and I needed to upgrade to a more powerful Mac with more memory. This is a great computer and some of the minor issues from previous operating systems have been improved. The back lighting makes for an amazingly bright screen, and the intuitiveness of the Mac has been enhanced. A great computer. The model I bought was the "old version", which was introduced in Oct. '11, and the only major difference from the newest version, which was introduced a little less than 2 months ago, is the verson of the Intel processor. The operating system, size of the hard drive, and amount of RAM are all the same. Highly recommended.
-	What I got from Amazon stock: A brand new Lenovo Y510P laptop that emits a loud annoying buzzing noise which is coming from the LED screen. The protective film on the screen bezel suggests that it is a refurbished or a second-hand screen. The noise problem appears to be common: see [...]  and [...] etc.
+	The build and construction of the laptop is great. It feels solid, looks great, and it's super small and light. The keyboard and screen are very nice, though I do wish there was an option to get a non-glare type screen. I'm not used to these multi-touch touchpads so I'm still getting used to it, but so far it's slightly annoying having to click the whole pad instead of a separate tactile button and I haven't quite mastered it. Damn you Apple for popularizing both the touchpad with no buttons and the glare-type screen. Very minor complaints though; this really is a nice laptop--not just for the money; its a fantastic value--it feels like quality hardware that might cost much more.Out of the box I scraped the stickers off the front, booted it and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit was installed. The wireless worked right away (another older reviewer had trouble with theirs which had 10.04 installed I believe). One interesting thing is they had all the package repositories disabled, so you should go and enable them to get updates and to install more software. Another reviewer also commented on the interesting partition configuration. There is a small EFI partition required for boot, then a 3GB backup partition which I assume contains the original configuration, then a 175GB EXT4 root partition, an 8 GB swap partition, and the remaining space is configured as an NTFS partition, which auto-mounts and shows up on the desktop. It's usable space but quite odd that they did this.I prefer Xubuntu and I also wanted to use full-disk encryption as well as wipe out the odd partition config, so I downloaded the latest 64-bit (required for EFI) Xubuntu iso and used usb-creator-gtk to create a bootable USB 3.0 thumb drive with it. I allowed the installer to wipe out the existing installation and enabled FDE. I encountered no problems and it went quite smoothly and surprisingly fast. They really make it easy these days.The performance is great for what I am doing which is web browsing, email, Spotify, Skype, Dropbox, and the occasional software development in Eclipse. I do my heavy lifting on a decked-out desktop, so this is a perfect product for me. Everything feels quite responsive. The Skype video quality is great. My girlfriend who is a computer novice has no trouble logging in and using it either. She has a Macbook and likes to use this laptop more and she even complimented it on it's looks. I'm glad I went with this instead of the Acer Chromebook. The hardware seems nicer and if you plan on putting Linux on it anyway as I was, this might be a better product. Before I bought it I thought I might want to swap in an SSD, but the system is plenty responsive enough for me as is.I'm very happy with this purchase.EDIT: I've had the laptop for about 2 weeks now. I've decided the touchpad is pretty weak. I'm slightly downgrading my rating from a 5 to a 4. You might want to get a nice wireless mouse with this for any extended use.
-	I purchased this computer in March 2009.  First of all, it's over priced, you should get at least 120gb hard drive!  Half the space is already gone before it's delivered to your door.  The screen is pretty small, it's really hard to read at times, you can increase the screen size on Windows Explorer but that makes it hard to navigate through the pages. Secondly, I can never use it for an extended amount of time because it freezes. I have to shut it down and reboot !  I haven't loaded anything on it because there isn't room so I'm not taking up any space.  It also crashes and reboots on its own, I'll get some kind of crazy blue screen.  Also, regardless of where I am, when I'm using the internet, it decides to disconnect or give me a limited connectivity messages. Lastly and worst of all, the screen cracked!  Not sure if the dog or one of the kids stepped on it but I opened the screen and it looks cracked with broken pixels.  Called Sony, because I figured it would still be under warranty and was told it's not covered!  Had the same thing happen with my Dell computer and they fixed it with no problem, no questions asked!  Then, these people at Sony had the nerve to tell me that a new screen would cost around $600!!! That's over half of what I paid for this piece of garbage!  Oh well, you live and learn.  Don't buy anything because it's "CUTE".  That's really the only reason I did.  I guess I'll buy one of those $400 netbooks!
+	Bought this laptop a little over one year ago.  My older PCG-Z1WA (purchased in 2004) was showing it's age.  Since I travel overseas 6 months each year, I'm a bit tough on laptops.I liked the weight, looks and quality - plus it's a Sony!!  The only thing that I don't like is that I'm unable (so far) to get Solaris 10 running properly.  Once that happens, this will be a 5 star laptop. Right now, it's a 4.8.  Oh, and I could use a powered eSATA port, but other than that, this laptop is complete.Having a laptop that is capable of 8GB memory and comes with a 500GB hard drive is great.  The graphics capability is excellent, the auto-dim sensor and back lit keyboard is great when you're on a red-eye and having to do work.  You won't disturb your neighbor (too much).I'd buy this again, but the way Sony's have lasted for me, who knows what innovation they'll have in six years.  I'm looking forward to their next generation.  Maybe they'll have 500GB SSD as standard!
+	I love this MacBook, I used to have laptops, and this is my first MacBook, and I thought i wasnt going to get used to it easy, but no, I cant believe how easy is to use. This MacBook is powerful, i could have many programs open at the same time and it runs fast, and the battery last longer than i thought..  So I'd recommend this 100%..
+	My Dell M5030 is my very first laptop ever. My mother decided as a gift for me for I am always paying bills and looking up something on my home computer and I needed to upgrade bad. So she figured I can have one on the go. And I have to say I am loving my Dell. The only thing I had an issue with was the touchpad, it is very touchy. So I decided to plug in my own mouse.  Other than that it works wonderful. THANX MOM!!!!
+	This review is about the product I purchased from KMM5086 - Amazon Marketplace <wnl1n2wrw32kjxg@marketplace.amazon.com>I bought two of these machines from Best Buy last year so I knew what to expect. The seller said it was only being sold as used because it was an open box; otherwise, it hadn't actually been used. For the price, even if it showed some wear, I would have been happy; but when it arrived, it looked exactly the way the other units did when I brought them home from Best Buy last year.Evidently, the seller must have turned it on before shipping it because Windows 7 was updated as of Oct 1, the day it shipped. I thought that was a very nice touch that saved us a lot of time.I bought this unit for my Daughter-in-law to play games like Diablo III on along with my son, who got one of the two identical units last year. After firing it up and getting the two updates recently released by Microsoft; and uninstalling a couple of things, we installed Diablo III and she was playing it when I left.I was a bit leery at first, with him being a new seller on Amazon but the description and price overrode my skepticism and I am very glad that it did. The other thing that worried me a tad was that there was no mention of where it was coming from; but once it shipped, FedEx let me know it was coming from FL. (I think he might mention the location of products he sells in the future.)I also paid for expedited shipping which said I would get the laptop in 4-6 days. It shipped Monday and arrived on Thursday. It doesn't get much better than that!I will be upgrading its memory this weekend, which will give me an opportunity to look inside the case a little bit. I do not anticipate any problems on that score. Again, everything looked brand new and pristine, as advertised.I am complete satisfied with this purchase at this time; and I would buy from this seller again without hesitation.
-	i bought this laptop with low hopes, thinking it would be at least able to get me through internet surfing. that's not the deal here. the processor is too slow to play a youtube video without freezing up the page and crackling the audio. tumblr, one of the main websites I use, takes about 5-15 minutes to load up all the images and such. sometimes it'll take more than 5 minutes to load up google. do yourself a favour, don't buy this laptop.
-	This computer is okay until you want to watch movies or play facebook games, It freezes every 5 seconds and gets WAY TOO HOT!!!  Do NOT buy this, opt for anything else!  Very dissatisfied older customer!
+	I purchased this laptop recently.  My family and I have been very happy with it and feel we got a good deal.  We are enjoying it greatly.
+	es un poco grande, en velocidad y capacidad esta muy bien, el diseño es un poco extraño ya que tiene esas bolitas por toda la computadora,,,Pero si es bastante barata para la capacidad que tiene.
-	Don't purchase this laptop if you plan on installing windows 8 it will not work. Upgraded to Windows 8 from Windows 7. Installed all the new drivers supplied by Asus but it crashed so many times had resort back to Windows 7. Then upgraded to Windows 8.1 when it was released but had the same exact problem. Looking at all the complaints on the web Asus is aware of this situation but is not issuing a fix.
+	I bought this product from Amazon, it's good on the overall performance, however it was delivered with a malfunctioned hard-drive, which then I had to replace from Apple store in Barcelona. Now that the machine has been restored, it's working very effectively and it's a high performance machine. I would recommend it to business users, who are looking to be more productive in such a dynamic and fast moving business Environment.However, I would give a short comment to Apple to fully inspect their devices before it's out for sale. this is not the first incidence I experience a problem with technical issues.  I purchased an ipad before from a New York Apple store. It  also had a functional problem and then I had to replace it from Apple store in Tennessee.Being a strong Apple fan, I would much rather have apple double checking their quality aspects of the product before its out for delivery to customers.Thanks,Ahmed S. Gaara
+	I acquired this laptop from a friend and I upgraded it to have 4Gb's of RAM and a 60Gb SSD and a wireless N card. Its fast as hell. Also it runs Pear OS so its faster than Windows would be.
+	This is an excellent laptop computer.  Extremely fast and easy to set up.  Apple definitely has the user in mind with MacBook Pro.  I would highly recommend this computer to anyone interested in purchasing a high quality laptop!
-	The battery status indicator light doesn't let you know when a full charge is reached, just a solid light when plugged up!!!!!!
+	Very pleased with the HP ENVY 17.3 Touch Laptop. I'm upgrading from windows XP and enjoying learning Windows 8 with "Teach Yourself Visually Windows". If you need to do something quickly you can toggle back to desktop view. It has everything I was looking for: a touch screen with great resolution, 2.4GHz ,8GB RAM, 1TB Hard Drive, DVD burner, Multimedia Card Slot, 4 USB 3.0 ports and a Webcam. The vendor also was great to work with. The first laptop I received had a problem with the touch screen and they shipped a replacement the next day. I would definitely recommend this laptop.
+	i had a HP laptop and this is my first Mac computer and i am very happy with this computer, it was the best choice. recommended
-	I purchased this laptop it lasted 45 days then started overheating and freezing up! Customer service said the month expired -no support ! Save your money and  look elsewhere don't risk lemons!
+	as advertised,very pleased,good deal /would buy again. i had one before now for work it was a real work horse
+	Very tough and we got it used on Amazon.  The keyboard is not as kid proof and its easy to remove keys.
-	Wanted to love it, but the WiFi kept dropping out.  I updated all the software, but no luck.  I returned it and opted for a different brand to avoid any further issues.
+	I love this laptop! Seriously best purchase for school and all of my other uses. I would recommend this laptop to everyone, it's the best. I have used a lot of different PC laptops, and they just didn't cut it. I was a VAIO user for a while, and I feel like I wasted so much money after using my new Mac!!
-	This laptop was given to me as a gift from my parents.  I have had nothing but troubles with this piece of crap.  First of all this laptop has overheating problems.  HP is aware of this problem as they issued a mass recall about 5 years ago, but obviously they still haven't fixed it.This overheating problem happens every time that I watch movies or play games on it.  It becomes so hot that any contact with the metal (or the cheap plastic) that covers the outside of the laptop will literally burn you.When I ask HP about it they said, "Be more careful."  These people scammed my parents out of close to $1,000.  I am trying to return this crap, but HP will not assume responsibility for the defect.  They insist that they shipped out a completely perfect laptop that I broke within the first week of use.Give me a break.  Buying from companies like this, makes me want to vote for the free loading democrats just so they can bankrupt this piece of crap corporation.
-	I am surprised it is legal to sell these things at this price. This isn't a computer its a toy. There is no power to it, it can't handle very much. For example: I made a quick video of footage I took from xmas. iMovie chugged the whole time, and the video came out all choppy. I used the same footage on my wifes ipad with her imovie and it came out fine!Speaking of imovie this comes with the new version which is awful in my opinion. And you can't downgrade to the older superior version.I could go on forever about this (like the un-upgradable ram, poor performance for games, constant reboots and freezing) but I will end with some pros because there are some....I use this to watch movies and browse the web, I am using it now to type this. The battery life is great and it is amazingly light and slim. And lets face it, apple makes a slick looking product. So if you just need something to browse the internet and watch movies this does a fine job and looks good doing it. However I'd say same your money and get the macbook pro.
-	The Toshiba arrived quickly and died quickly. I turned it on and began charging the battery. When I went to use it it completely froze and would not shut down. It made an incredibly annoying high pitched buzzing sound too. I followed all the shut down options, checked the internet on my desktop for solution, but I could not get it to stop buzzing or unfreeze. I ended up putting it in a room on the other side of the house until the battery died. Thankfully Amazon took it back and gave me a full refund.
-	I'm really upset with this product I resived because they don't specif a lot of things  ,they didn't send me the AC adapter charger  just the toughbook with a lot of scrathed ,they said refurbished product and is used product unacceptable don't buy it .
-	This machine has been amazing except for the rapidly declining battery life.  When first purchased it was getting 11 hours of battery life and now, just a few months later, I can BARELY get 5-6 hours out of it.I understand the various factors that reduce battery life, including your usage, screen brightness, etc -- but to have my battery life cut in half is completely ridiculous.  I did a bit of searching online and it seems like this is a VERY common issue with this model.  There are posts all over the Apple forums but Apple refuses to acknowledge the issue.I would save my money until they come out with a fix.  There is no sense paying this much when you get half the battery they claim.
-	I have edited this review multiple times out of a sense of fairness. After all, things go wrong sometimes. A single piece of faulty hardware does not implicate an entire line. But terrible warranty repair? Multiple times? A driver issue that many customers have and Asus cannot or will not fix? I am so angry at this point that I am opening a case with the BBB. Asus has gone beyond bad service into actually damaging whatever value is left in my laptop. I shall spend the semester saving money to buy a brand new $1000+ laptop I can ill-afford just to replace this utter piece of crap.Straight of the box, the NS7SF is pretty awesome. The only complaint I had was the touchpad, which had buttons chosen for aesthetics without regard for how much pressure is required to use them. But the screen was brilliantly vivid; whites were bright enough to require a lowering of the brightness and blacks were pitch-black even at the highest brightness settings. The videocard ran modern games like Left 4 Dead 2 on high settings without overheating. And the sound was fantastic, even without the sub-woofer. A friend of mine walked into my living room and thought I was playing music from my tv instead of the N75SF. There really wasn't anything I wasn't satisfied with aside from the touchpad. Even the case seemed sturdy; unlike my previous laptop, the back of the LCD panel didn't bend inward if I happened to place something on top of it.This lasted until the USB ports started having issues with a half-dozen different devices. Code 10 error after using them once and then plugging them back in later. The only way to fix it was to restart the entire system. Kind of a pain if you are multi-tasking and just need to do one small thing on a USB device. I tried multiple factory resets without any change. Eventually, I RMA'ed it. But this was only after the power-harness became so loose I had to fight with the jack to get it to charge. This all by April, and I bought the laptop in October.So, Asus pays for the shipping to/from the RMA center and are pretty quick about it, too. Maybe two weeks, including shipping time. But when I get it, I find out that the harness is still slightly loose, though not nearly as bad; I suspect I will run into the exact same power issue within six months, however. The motherboard was replaced, but didn't fix the USB issues (meaning it was a driver issue that Asus *somehow* was unaware of up until then). They also replaced a speaker somewhere because I was having issues with the sound disappearing, but there's no telling if it was hardware or driver.Finally, they replaced the LCD screen. This was neither desired nor requested by me. They saw some problems with the screen (a few small bright spots that had never bothered me because they were only visible against extremely light backgrounds). That, initially, seemed quite lovely. They saw a problem and took proactive action, right? Wrong. They replaced the screen with a substandard, non-stock model. This screen was duller than the $300 Compaq screen in my old laptop. It lacked any vividness and whites were not white, but grey. I was furious, but I was busy with moving.Fast forward less than a month, the day before a trip to the city I was moving to, and the LCD screen fails entirely. Would not come on at all. Obviously, Asus is using refurbished parts, regardless of their condition, to satisfy their warranties. So it gets sent in again. I get it back fairly quickly and they've replaced it with a slightly different LCD model, but at least it's somewhat comparable. It's not as bright and reflects like a mirror (unlike the original), but at least it's brighter than the Compaq laptop (unlike the first replacement). But it's also refurbished since it came stock with dead pixels. I also just absolutely love that they managed to break the speaker plate above the keyboard; neither end will stay down now.So, to reiterate, Asus first tried using a sub-standard, non-stock replacement part for an undesired and unrequested repair. When that part failed, they went with a better model (but still refurbished) replacement part, but broke a part of the laptop before sending it back to me. My $1300 was certainly money well spent; multiple reinstallations, multiple RMA's, and at the end of the day, I still have a slightly broken laptop.That said, if the only thing you care about is a very quick warranty service that will get your laptop functioning enough to use (even if only for a little while), Asus is perfect.I give props to their (I suspect foreign) customer service representatives (I contacted them through e-mail). They were always very polite, even when my temper was frayed. But that is absolutely the only positive thing I can say about my experience with Asus.
-	Acer didn't even bother to wire the 2nd hard drive bay.It costs you $60+ for the cable and brackets and lots of research to make the laptop usable.I will NEVER buy an Acer again.
+	`A decent PC for the price, but there are several negat1ves to be aware of:network port is NOT gigabit, it is only 10/100.  So if you will be copying large files to this PC over a wired gigabit network (as most people do these days), then the transfer rate will be SLOW.The keyboard lacks the standard inverted-T layout for the arrow keys. Most people that use the arrow keys for navigating spreadsheets, gaming, etc would consider the inverted-T arrangement very important.Users Manual on the HP site is one-size fits all, it is NOT specific to this model of PC.  Much of what is in the manual does not pertain to this PC.Downloadable drivers on the HP site are for 64-bit Windows 8 only.  So if you want to install Windows 7 on this PC, you could have a problem.How long does the battery last?  The answer is anyone's guess, because HP does not mention this anywhere.  Also, what is the replacement lithium battery pack for this PC?  Who knows, because the HP website does not have this information either.
+	I received my HP, and am still gettng used to all the features. I don't like Windows 8, but in fairness it has only been a short time. The one disappointment is the casing of this HP doesn't have the stability of my last two hp's. The hard drive is on the right side close to the front and when I pick up the computer, it seems as if it would be easy to crack or break. I am happy with the speaker's the volume is pretty good. Picture quality is also good. For the price I would recommend this computer, my order came with an upgrade to 6 mb for the memory.
-	I am a graphic designer on a budget, and thought this would work well as the specs are very similar to my other machine I am very happy with but is quite old and large. Being into graphics there is no way I would ever be able to work on this machine because it has very pixely edges on everything making things blurry. I do not know if I got a dud or if they are all this way but there is no graphic quality in order to properly edit on this machine. I am quite disappointed. It also seems to struggle under too many applications and I wasn't even running Adobe's creative suite. Not to mention that this new operating system is pretty nasty to navigate through. I did download the classic shell, which made it more user friendly but not enough for me. I think I am going MAC next.
-	Do not buy this laptop. After one year, my battery needed to be replaced. Then the hard drive needed to be replaced. Now I am getting the infamous 7 beeps after only a year and a half. Luckily, I have a two year warranty.  I will buy another laptop soon because this thing is horrible.
+	This product arrived in perfect condition and when expected. Setup was easy if your computer savy. I am happy with the price I paid, given it typically is higher at most other vendors.
-	I wanted a Gateway as a previously owned model was rugged.This machine is Agonizingly (capital A) slow & cheap. I needed a light laptop to carry around in my backpack.  I have a Lenovo (android) IdeaPad tablet but it limits application I need.This laptop has cheap plastic lid has scratches & is basically ugly .Screen to keyboard controls poorly calibrated, meaning touchscreen functions are too easily set-off, even with adjustment?!.Touchpad insensitive & really doesn't work properly.  No CAPS LOCK indicator lite, so I just waste time when I'm in a hurry.Keeps dropping internet signal when 2nd browser is in use.Performance is biggest letdown.  It's just a slowwww operating machine like something from the 90's.Price sold me on CyberMonday after Christmas, and I got what I paid for: MiserablyNot the Gateway of years ago.  Now owned by Acer who probably uses the once very rugged/reliable name.
-	Certainly the main attraction of this model is getting the touchscreen, a critical feature for taking advantage of Windows 8, and making this computer's price attractive. The touchscreen worked fine out of the box, and for about 20 hours of use after that, but then starting working irregularly, and often not at all. I can't use most of the touch features of Windows 8 now. Even worse, the touchpad also stopped working, apparently for different reasons. I've spent hours on the phone with Sony Vaio support, and while they were eventually able to solve the touchpad problem (for now, at least, though occasionally it still freezes), they are clueless about the touchscreen, and have wasted a lot of my time having me restoring and reloading software and drivers, all to no avail. They've finally told me I should send the machine to them. My last experience with a Vaio suggests that what will happen is that they will wipe out the disk, reload the original software, and send the machine back to me, so it can fail again. I think this is the machine that will finally drag me into the Mac world.Windows 8 with a (working) touchscreen on an ultrabook is a pretty good combination, by the way. My main complaint would be that the new tablet-like apps designed to take advantage of the touchscreen seem more geared to a phone or small tablet--they tend to be somewhat stripped down in terms of functionality, presumably to be able to limit the screen to a few easy-to-press buttons, which is useful on a small screen but an unnecessary trade-off on a 13-inch notebook.
-	1. This retailer is one of those web guys which always made you worried about buying things from the net.2. He will sell you a "rebufrished" product as brand new and then will not take any responsibility.3. I had this Laptop written pre-owned all over it but I was too naive to understand it. Sorry !! buddy your bad luck--is all the website said.4. When i complained (in writing & over the phone), i got a flat NO.So my advice, avios this retailer at all costs.
+	Great price and so sleek sexy looking laptop. Bought this for a gift and she is loving it, highly recommended.
-	I bought this because my son thought it was a great deal. Have had nothing but trouble with it. Asus customer service is non existent to say the least. NOT SATISFIED......
-	I purchased this for my eighty year old mother and she just loved it. She never moved it, rather she used it like a desktop computer. However, within 6 months the entire computer went black and we were unable to revive it.
+	I waited a month before writing this review to make sure my initial impression would hold up & it did.MacBook Pro's -1. Track Pad (Fantastic!)2. No Trial Software (everything installed is fully functional - no more nag screens)3. Battery Life (I get around 5 or 6 hours on a charge)4. Incremental Backups with Time Machine (You can use almost any external HD instead Apple's expensive Time Capsule)5. Support is Awesome (Nuff said)6. It's Just Plain Sexy (No more Windows bricks for me...)MacBook Con's -1. No HDMI out2. USB Ports too close together3. Steve Jobs is DeadIf you're a long time Windows user; ask yourself if this story sounds familiar?You've got a girlfriend/boyfriend who annoys you on a daily basis, but you stick with her/him year after year because you don't want to spend the time learning the ins & outs of a new one?Then one day, a sleek, sexy chick/dude catches your eye & you start hanging out with her/him & pretty soon you're kicking that old broad/bum out on the street.That's me & Microsoft.I started; decades ago, as a DOS user with an 8088 machine & continued all the way up to Windows 7.I've got a new girlfriend now & she blows the old one away.The old one just blows.
-	Very, very good computer but Win 8 with a touch screen makes no sense for the productive types. If you are serous about what you do on a computer, don't turn you laptop into a tablet. I called SONY the day I got it to ask of I could downgrade to Win7. Beware, Win8 is for tablets not PC and laptops. Run from this giant mistake of an offering.
-	Everything on this computer is slow or slower. Opening a window like My Computer can take about 30-45 seconds. Closing one even longer. If a window freezes while sufacing, go get a cup of coffee because that revolving circular thingy will be going for at least a minute. It's insane. This new operating system has none of the snap that Windows XP had. Everything kind of 'floats' open, like it's in no rush. Despite having 4GB of RAM and a 320GB Hard Drive and doing little more than surfing and some word processing, this computer is just plain garbage. I will say, after my HD fried, SONY did provide excellent customer service as it was still under the one year warranty. Stay away!!!
+	I saved up my money for months to buy this laptop to use for both school and leisure. Having done so, I can attest that it is worth every penny. Everything about it runs quickly and with great ease, and it's workmanship feels so intuitive. Setup was a breeze, and this is coming from someone who knows absolutely nothing about computers - my ignorance of computers and desire for one that would be easy to use is one of the reasons I bought this in the first place! As far as I'm concerned the money was well spent, and I can't foresee not continuing to feel that way for years to come.
+	First, the operating system is that much better than windows. It does take a little getting used to if you aren't familiar with Macs, but once you get a good feel for where everything is located you realize that the system is much more intuitive and geared to the user than windows. The battery life is outstanding, the processor is incredibly fast, and if you get a solid state hard drive the thing is indestructible. I can't tell you how many times I've dropped mine with zero problems.
-	The computer randomly turns itself off when I'm in the middle of doing something. This may happen 2-3 times in a row, and each time it takes at least 30-45 seconds for the computer to turn back on. I just get a black screen with a mouse cursor button and unable to get any response by pressing any buttons, including the power button. Just have to sit there and wait for the computer to come back from the ether...Second issue is the keyboard - although the thinness is pretty incredible and great for portability, this is the LEAST ergonomically designed computer I've ever used! After less than a minute of typing on this super flat keyboard, my wrists are KILLING me and I'm young! It physically hurts to keep my hands on the keyboard - the chassis is far too thin - the distance between the edge of the computer to the start of the keyboard is literally 1.5x longer than any other laptop - so almost half my forearm rests on the computer in order to type. I should only have to put my wrists and hands on the computer to type. I end up using my horrible, clunky Lenovo work computer to do any serious typing or even gchatting with friends because it's just not worth it physically to me to do anything but browse the net or watch videos on this thing. The pain is too much.Finally, the newly designed power adaptor SUCKS. You so much as look at the thing, and it falls out. You cannot use the laptop in your lap while it's plugged in because the power cord falls out of the side of the thing. It's seriously the worst design I've ever seen. I guess Apple doesn't think you should use laptops in your lap unless they're fully charged. The only redeeming quality is the batter life is long enough where I can afford to use it unplugged in my lap for a few hours. Even when it's sitting on my desk, if i move the laptop even slightly, the power cord falls out.
+	As my title says, I'm a long time PC user for the last 15 years or so, in multiple desktop and laptop forms.  My photography hobby demanded I get a machine better designed to handle multimedia applications and digital photo post processing.  Although it's pricy, I decided to go for the 15" MacBook Pro with the dedicated GPU for extra video processing power and the 750 GB HD for storage.  I can say this purchase was well worth it.  I have used Apple computer products since early college and they gone from being impressive looking but playing catchup to PCs in terms of utilities, to creating their own niche.Coupled with a gorgeous LCD screen and powerful processor.  This machine is a joy to use in terms of ergnomics and performance.  Also it couples well with my Apple brand wireless Magic Mouse and the bluetooth pairing is effortless.
-	I found background light on Upper right corner on screen. So I got damaged Item, I am not sure how to review it.
+	Just bought my MacBook Pro last week. I love it. It's very fast and everything I expected. Apple makes great products. i only switched to Mac products a few years ago and it was well worth doing. I recommend this MacBook if your on a budget. I think it is well worth the price and is around $62 cheaper than buying it from an Apple store or their online store.
-	The hard disk made an awful sound, as if it was being scratched by the needle. The laptop is pretty nice, but it is a shame it came with this defect.
-	VERY BAD EXPERIENCE , SO BAD THAT I HAVE TO GET A NICE ONE ON THE SAME APPLE STORE, SO NO 2ND CHANCE FOR THEM!!
+	My computer suddenly quit on me and I needed a replacement--RIGHT NOW.  This was affordable and has given me excellent service.Lap top computers are obsolete for most people.  I needed word processing capability and other computer functions in addition to internet access.  The screen is sharp, I can play DVD movies, and I get the word processing capability I need for my many projects.
+	Well this is the first Macbook I have ever owned and to say the least, I am not sorry about spending a little extra. The quality of this Aluminum notebook is unbelievable. To get this from Amazon also, just makes my purchase that much better. When Apple released the 2011 refresh with this Sandybridge chip I jumped on it. I actually was one of the first consumers to get this Intel chipset in an HP notebook that was part of the recall because of the mother board. I was able to use the notebook for a few weeks and was amazed how fast and powerful this chip was. Then I had to send it back but heard Apple was releasing this model.So when I seen that Apple was also using it, I couldn't resist. The chip can multitask like business and the new ATI graphics HD 6750M is a great addition. I am running Windows 7 Pro in bootcamp and all Windows programs run perfectly as do graphic intensive games. The 1 GB of GDDR5 Ram really help textures in games fly. I am very happy with the gaming capability as well as my work capabilities. I am running Adobe CS5 and even with only 4GB of Ram for now...it really hasn't slowed at all.....the Sandybridge is more than strong enough for video encoding. You can do so much all at one time it isn't funny. I think eventually I will upgrade to 8GB of RAM when I find it for the right price.So and professional that wants this notebook for work and play wont be disappointed.
-	Purchased a Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga in December; last week it just stopped working.  I had paid for the upgraded warranty, and they overnighted me a box to return it to their repair center.  I had asked for a local place in Houston to take it to and they directed me to a partner finding page on their website.  The customer care rep had no idea who to call.  After calling 3 different venders from the list and finding them all out of service, went with the overnight shipping back to the repair center.Received it back the following Friday with a note saying they replaced the motherboard and everything was tested and working correctly.  But, still did not work!  Called customer support; was advised they could ship me another box to have returned back to the repair center.  Asked to either have someone sent to the house to repair it, ship me a new computer, or refund my money.  Was put on hold so the guy could talk to his team leader.  After 15 min was sent back to the switchboard, transferred back and disconnected.  Called again, new rep was rude, could not find original info, and when asked for his name, hung up on me.  Called again, and finally got a team leader to call me back.  Said he could ask for  a one time exception to have someone come to the house, but it would have to be approved, and probably wouldn’t be.  Same response for immediately shipping out a new computer, or refunding my money so I could purchase a better brand.  We need this computer for our business and this long delay is unacceptable.  So I told him to email me a shipping lable and I would immediately put it in the mail back to them, his response, we have to ship you a whole new box and label?????  I have the box I just received 2 hours ealier, just send me the label!The worst customer support I have ever received.  They should buy and apple product and call their support to learn how to operate.  I will be trying to get my money back to do just that!
+	I highly recommend getting some type of laptop sleeve with it, Laptop Sleeve 15 inch Neoprene Surf Art Style, there's something about this particular design that I just love. Makes such a difference now that I use it daily. Besides the actual case being lightweight and tough, it fits my Mac like a glove, I recommend it. In summary, the Apple Macbook Pro is second to none. The speed of the processor alone is worth the purchase price, my internet speed literally tripled when I first got online with my Mac. Highly Recommended!
-	Terrible cracking and poping noises when used with Lenovo Docking station.  Use your web search to go to "Lenovo W530 cracking noise"  This will lead you to an article on Lenovo's own community discusson website where this problem was reported in July 2012 and is still being reported on new W530's shipped in December 2012 6 months later.  In that community page Lenovo techs believe this due to a defect in the Motherboard design meaning it affects all W530s and the only way to repair is to send the unit to a service depot for several weeks where they will remove and replace the motherboard.  While this only presents when the laptops is used with a docking station, its unknown if the issue shortens the life of the unit or will lead to further complications.
-	I got this from Amazon under a clearance sale where it was apparently known that this PC was defective.  It freezes up constantly as many other unhappy customers will testify.  Took me too long to figure out it wasn't my software, so now I'm stuck with this piece of junk.NEVER BUY ANY COMPUTER EQUIPMENT FROM HP, and since Amazon apparently knew they were pushing junk, I would also avoid that merchant as well.
+	Buying a computer is somewhat like buying a car.  As soon as you receive it there's a newer and better model out on the market.  However, I expect to use and enjoy my computer for as long as I possibly can.  Love it!
+	If you're any bit into web dev/other programmy/code-y stuff, linux/ubuntu can't be beat by much. I am loving the small form factor of this netbook. I had a 17 inch, 12 lb laptop and I couldn't handle carrying it around everywhere.I could go on and on about this, but this is from someone who is now preferring this little netbook over her custom built gaming PC rig with insane performance.If you're on the go a lot, i.e. business stuff, I really suggest it..edit: I keep reading about people buying this from other places. I got mine refurbished from amazon warehouse, for 313$ including 1 day prime shipping. Came in perfect condition except for 2 tiny non-noticeable scratches. I REALLY suggest buying through them.
-	I bought this in February 14th 2013 and the monitor no longer works.  I bought the top of the line product from them I-7 processor and a Solid State Hard Drive.  I paid over 1500 for this laptop thinking I would be well taken care and I would have had this laptop at least the next 3 to 4 years.  30 Days out of warranty the computer has lost its ability to transmit the information to the monitor.  This is a known issue with the Yogo laptops.  It has something to do with the hinge that connects the laptop and monitor together.Lenovo does not care about you are a customer and are only concerned about their money.  Any reputable company would take care of this issue being that the laptop is totally useless.DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER YOU WILL HAVE NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED SO POORLY FROM A COMPANY.LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER 1 STAR REVIEWS.  DON’T BE FOOLED BY MARKETING THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU AFTER THE PURCHASE
+	Best laptop I've ever had. I'm a music producer so I use my laptop to make music and this laptop has become my most important tool. Os x is a great system.
+	"Thank you so much for great swift shipping. I ordered a custom built Toshiba from Toshiba in November. It arrived DOA. This seller delivered a better computer, for less money in record time, and it worked right out of the box. Could not ask for more as a customer. I wish you great luck in your amazon business.I was so pleased to see your selection of Toshiba computers and how they were equipped.  I wanted Windows 7 Professional since I have heard 8 is not great.  Sort of like Vista., an Intel i7 processor, hd output, Nvidia graphics, backlit keyboard, backlit screen, and at least 500gb hard drive.  I originally also ordered a Samsung 840 professional ssd in 500 gb.  But since the manufacturer (the one from Toshiba, not this fine seller) laptop was doa, I returned the Samsung evo.I love the sleek aluminum finish, the thiness, the Harmon Kardon speakers, the SPEED and the GRAPHICS!  Much better than the custom one I ordered direct from Toshiba which did not have a Blu Ray player and only came with 8 gb of ram.  My custom laptop was $1189.99.  So this one is less money, with much better enhancements.  It arrived two days after the order was placed, unlike three weeks from China and Toshiba!I wish I could have afforded the top of your selection with two hard drives.  If you designed these, they are perfect for gaming or for someone like me who wants performance.  Hands down the best fit for the money for my pocketbook.  All of your Toshiba computers are great buys and designed with the customer in mind.  Even comes with the option of windows 8 if I choose to dare to go there.  Thanks again.I would like to update my review with the information that I was able to purchase an extended warranty on this Toshiba laptop for service years 2 and 3 and accidental damage for all 3 years from Toshiba Direct for very reasonable pricing.
-	I bought the Dell Inspiron 1525 as a high-school graduation gift for my daughter last year. She took it to college and had nothing but problems. The laptop would shut down for no apparent reason. We spent hours on the phone with Dell support who could not fix the problem. Since that time I have done a number of internet searches and found that this particular model has a tendency to overheat, which causes the laptop to automatically shut down. End of story - I bought my daughter an Apple Macbook and she is very happy. Stay away from Dell.
+	We bought this for our daughter who is a professional traveler.  She uses it to file her expense reports and loves this computer for its size and power.
+	I have received this computer two days, i find the "capslock" key can't work well, sometimes it doesn`t work, i have to press it use more strength. Except for it,i haven't find other problems.
-	Dell forgot to include any type of cap lock light and when the adapter is plugged in the light is on the adapter instead of the computer.  There is cheap and too cheap.  Still deciding if I'll keep or return.  Just an initial impression.
-	This unit may look good on paper, but what I received wasn't exactly what was advertised.  Remember, this is billed as a NEW unit with a Backlit Keyboard.  There is even a sticker to the right of the touchpad advertising the backlit keyboard feature.What I received did not look factory new and not even Toshiba Support could make the backlit keyboard work.  Immediately when I unpacked it, I noticed a small scratch on the display.  I could have lived with a minor scratch on the back or bottom, even though a new machine should be scratch-free, but a scratched display is unacceptable.  The "backlit keyboard" didn't work right out of the box.  In fact, it never did light up, even after a call to Toshiba support and an hour of my life I'll never get back.  This unit is not what I would call 100% NEW.  When I called Toshiba support, they told me it was a good thing I called when I did, as this unit only had 5 days of free support left from Toshiba.  Their records show it as being sold around the first of this year (This is April).  I understand things sit on the shelves sometimes before they are sold, but I don't think it's unrealistic to expect to be able to get support for a new laptop for longer than 5 days after you receive it.  And I paid for 2-day shipping to boot!The unit itself was rather sluggish and, for lack of a better word, "doggy" in operation.  The touchpad takes some getting used to, especially the "push hard with one finger to left-click and push hard with two fingers to right-click" part.  My old Dell Latitude D620 with 4GB of RAM, an ancient processor, and a cheap solid state drive is snappier than this unit was.  Do yourself a favor and buy something else.  I returned mine the same day and regret the wasted time, effort and money.
-	I am very upset with this product and Toshiba customer service. Problems started with a few keys not working and the F key seemingly stuck and progressed to no keys working whatsoever. Toshiba wants $10.55 and $60 labor to repair something that is covered under warranty. I asked for the laptop to be returned to me and I will have someone local repair it. I have a Samsung laptop that has given me no problems at all and I'll be going with Samsung in the future.
-	I was given this laptop by the school and I want to say that this laptop is absolutely horrible for its intended purposes.- It is flimsy and cheap. The back light is a constant issue and it heats up at the drop of a pin.- The fan spits out plastic after too long of a usage.- Requires constant restarts due to "internal issues"- The keys fall off.- The whole thing is loosely screwed together, leaving the screws to loosen and fall out.- It crashes and or freezes with light knocks (i. e. putting my books on my desk when the computer is out)I am currently using this laptop to write this review but I would prefer anything over this... thing. In other words, this product is a no go. Get yourself the HP Pavilion dm4-3170se 14-Inch Laptop (Black) or the Lenovo 14" Core i5 500GB HDD 4GB DDR3 Ultrabook. They are cheaper for the value and more funtional. Summary: Don't. Buy.
-	I am really sick of these "dummy" proof, easy to sync, easy to use products that are not easy to use.  Why do I need a genius to show me how to use my computer?  I pay a premium for this ease and compatibility, and I don't see it.  I see wasted money and a cool looking computer.  This is not my first apple purchase.  4 iPods, an ibook, and an iPhone 4s that I had to replace 3 times for issues.I don't like having to buy extended protection, buy classes to teach my how to use it, and wait in ridiculous lines if I don't have an appointment to get my easy product to work.  You get the point, I could go on and on for hours, but I have wasted more than that with this frustrating device.the mail program is glitchy at best, iPhoto is in disarray and even when you make folders, the photos go where they want.  I updated to 10.9 maverick, whatever that is and it deleted my emails in my inbox; oh, and on the server too.  So that was a fun surprise.  I have had enough.  No thank you.
-	I didn't like my Mac Book, I only rated it one star because the thing wouldn't let me put none.
+	This is my first computer, which I got for college, although I have plenty of experience with using other people's Macs and PCs. One of the reasons I chose a Mac over another PC laptop is the Find My Mac feature with iCloud, so if I ever lose it I can pinpoint it on a Map.I am very happy with it. It's light, it looks great (and great attention to detail), it's super fast, and I love using Lion. In all fairness, I got a customized version with an SSD instead of the default HDD, but with that I can go from cold boot to coding in Dreamweaver in under 20 seconds, which I think is amazing.Trackpad is nice and large, works well with gestures. I had to change some point-and-click preferences however to get it working the way I wanted.I also run Windows 7 (and now, Windows 8) virtual machines with VMware Fusion and Parallels, with an external 1080p monitor, and it can give Windows full graphics acceleration, which I find impressive.One last thing that I love about this is the battery life: I can go over 10 hours on this thing, provided I'm not watching videos or gaming and that I don't have the screen at full brightness.It's not a *perfect* laptop however. I personally am not a fan of the glossy screen. It sometimes reflects lights, and if I touch it, I get a finger print on it, and that doesn't look good until I clean it off.
-	Look online and you'll find that most people who have actually recieved this computer and more than a few other models has audio problems when doing something as simple as listening to mp3s, a cd, or when gaming.  It's an audio leveling issue and is due to the fact that HP's driver/engineering firm chose to lock out simple options in the IDT/Beats software allowing us to diable sound level auto adjustment.  Let's just say this, it turns your music listening experience into a rollercoaster of high and low volumes.  I might consider re-rating this to probably closer to 4 stars if I didn't have to go through a convoluted route to fix things that disables functionality in the software.  And, no...  Driver upates directly from IDT do not fix things so don't bother going there.  You should be able to unbox a computer and it should work, not have functionality unavailable.  Pity the people who buy the 3D version and are still waiting for WIDI to get fixed...Looks: (It's pretty, can't deny that)Software:  Lousy, terrible, horrible, deplorable HP driver support/service.  No updates since last may.  Tragic considering the aforementioned audio issues and the desire for using this for minor gaming which means you'll never get a driver update for the video card so have fun with games in the future.  Good luck dealing them to get a problem dealt with, in any way or form.  You've been warned on this one.  For some reason I had a horrid time trying to get my SSD to load windows with the recovery disks I burned, not sure why.  I would suggest just finding a cheap version of 7 pro or ultimate, doing a clean install figuring out what HP software you still need for functionality (can be found in the SWSETUP folder).Hardware:  Great, great battery life, great i/o speeds with my cherrville SSD and true SATA 6gb/s, so no complaints.  Been able to play Skyrim at full HD with good performance, happy there.  Seems quite stable once I figured out the driver/ssd issues.  Slot loading drive seems to eat up disks a bit, still not convinced it is proper, but haven't noticed any deep scratches.  Not suprisingly they used el crappo high latency ram when they shipped it, not impressed with that.  It's a bit annoying that you have to purchase a separate hard drive caddy to have two hard drives secure without having to jeri-rig things.  Trackpad isn't too terrible.  Computer hinge could be a bit tighter.Overall I'm happy with the computer, will be keeping it but the sofware issues annoy the hell out of me and I refuse to give it higher than a 1 until this is fixed properly by HP.  Consider it payback for keeping me on the phone for six hours over the last few weeks.EDIT 11-15-2012:  Audio leveling issues still NOT FIXED by HP!!  More than a few of us still can't listen to music through the headphones without a roller coaster of volume!!
-	After purchasing this laptop it has performed very well and been able to handle any game that I threw at it. However, after owning this latop for 13 months, one month out of warranty the motherboard goes up in smoke "literally". Attempting to contact and discuss the issue with Dell and their customer service has been difficult enough but after finally getting ahold of a Alienware tech his advice was "I guess you could sell if for parts... we are offering some great deals on new laptops". For the price this laptop costs I expected it to be an investment to last well over a year but apparently that is not the case. I would recommend only buying this laptop if you are familar with building laptops and can handle buying and replacing parts within it as they break.
-	I'm very sad and angry with this seller. He didn't send the laptop that I bought, He shipped me a more cheap laptop than I bought.I don't like and want the laptop that he shipped me. This is not right! I don't recommend him. on laptop box said s55-a5364 but inside there was a laptop Toshiba s55-5176.  I was cheated by this seller. I want to cry because I paid 730$ for one laptop that it's not that I want. the laptop don't have backlit keyboard ;( heeeelp!!
-	I have had my computer for going on 5 months now, and for the first 4 months it was amazing!!!! THEN, the mouse started freaking out - unresponsive and randomly re-sizes the screen. There is no hardware or software fix for it outside of using a physical mouse. Now, it won't charge. The computer cable is useless - the pins inside are falling out. I will NEVER invest in this type of computer again! My husband bought the newer version at the same time, and the pin fell OUT of the charging area, and the screen is busted!! UPDATE: It's been over a year now, and this review is still the same. It was a truly amazing computer to begin with - none better. Now, it overheats and melts a soldering point inside, which makes the charging cable useless (we've had it fixed twice now). The warranty ran out after a year, so the first repair was covered. Now, I pay $50 every time it happens. PLUS the touch mouse is completely fried - no solution for that. Not to mention, you MUST use a cooling pad under it, or it overheats with use and shuts off to save itself. It's not well built, and the guy that took it apart last time said it looks scorched inside because the overheating/electrical issues are actually cooking the innards! I'm looking forward to buying a new laptop :/ My husband's laptop has the exact same problem (the newer version of the same model). His is in the shop for repair now, another $50 :(
-	I wish I would have done a more comprehensive search of user feedback on the web rather than the professional reviews of this computer.  Sure it's a good bargain, it seems fast and works ok but the piece that I missed was the overwhelming number of users who reported sticking keys.  Guess what 18 days of using my computer keys began to not work.  I was so upset, called Dell and they wanted me to replace the parts.  They were happy to "walk me through" the process.....WHAT?! I have an 18 day old non working computer and Dell wants me to do the repairs???  I balked and then they agreed that since it was within 30 days they would send a tech out.  Oh, the techs don't work evenings or weekends, and I don't have a flexible schedule.....so we set up an appointment at lunch, and the tech doesn't show, only to call me to tell me he is on his way at the point I have to be back at work.It gets better.  I am livid at this point, what a waste of money.  I froze the charge since it was all so new.  I call back Dell again and tell them that I froze the charge and want to send the computer back.  Turns out I only had 21 days from PURCHACE to send it back.  Doesn't matter I've only had the computer in my possession for 18 days; it was too late since I was over the 21 days.  I could cry.  On a limited budget I get a computer with keys that don't work and service techs that don't show up.  By the way, the last Dell rep threatened to screw my credit up if I didn't pay.....got to love that....Buyers beware.  It's all so wrong on a number of levels.
-	EDIT: since the last BIOS update issued by Samsung, there is a severe problem with battery drain during connected standby. I have been losing 25% charge during 8 hours of standby, and many users are reporting this same issue coinciding with the latest BIOS update in several forums. Unless Samsung resolves this, I would not purchase this device at the moment.I've been using Tablet PCs with active digitizers and styluses for nearly 10 years.This is, in short, the best device I've ever owned: thin and light, fantastic battery life (easily 9-10 hours for me), instant on, precise and very natural handwriting, full Windows 8 touch experience and full notebook functionality when you need the keyboard for typing.As a machine used mainly for running Microsoft Office, including OneNote, and web browsing, the combination of the Atom SOC with the SSD is plenty fast and responsive.I was hoping that my next machine would have a 1080p screen, but after briefly owning an Asus Taichi prior to the 500T, I almost prefer the lower resolution of the latter, because the desktop environment of Windows doesn't scale very well to higher resolutions on such a small screen.The only notable thing still remaining on my wish list is a backlit keyboard.Finally, contrary to some early reviews, I've haven't had any stability issues with the docking mechanism or Wi-Fi; my system has all the updates available from Samsung and has been rock-solid.
+	The update to the 15-inch MacBook Pro in February 2011 was significant. Indeed, significant may be an understatement when it comes to the increase of processor performance offered by the updated machines. Quick thanks to Amazon and Apple Stores for having these immediately available at launch.The primary upgrade to this revision? The processor! Intel has a brand new architecture called Sandy Bridge, and these MacBook Pros are the first Macs to feature this technology. Some have called it some of the most significant changes to Intel architecture since Pentium 4 was introduced. These 15-inch MacBook Pros as well as its big brother, the 17-inch, not only take advantage of Sandy Bridge, but the Quad Core i7 Variant. Quad Core processor in a notebook Mac! Wow.I actually chose the 13-inch model for my personal use (only Dual Core on the 13-inch), but a 15-inch is replacing an aging iMac at the office to save space and leap over its performance. These Quad Core Chips are amazing. Early benchmarks are showing this entry-level 15-inch, 50 percent faster than the upper end i7 15-inch MacBook pro from a year ago. A dramatic improvement. This higher end model is even better.  Furthermore, if you're still on a Core 2 Duo machine such as the iMac I am replacing, the performance is as much as 2.5 times faster and 3x faster with this higher end model. At least in terms of the processor. This is most beneficial in processor intensive applications, for consumers such applications are iMovie and Garageband. Professionals will see the new processors beneficial in any professional photo editing, video, or music work.This model also includes a fantastic dedicated graphics card with 1GB of graphics memory.  1GB of graphics memory is a a first for Mac notebooks.One downside is that due to cost, the machine still comes with a spinning hard drive standard. In this case, the standard drive is a 5400 RPM 750 GB drive. That offers plenty of storage, but is slightly slower than a desktop 7200RPM drive and much slower than a new, solid state drive. You do have options. You can special order the machine from Apple with a 7200RPM drive, or Solid State Drive. However, what I have decided to do, is simply, when I'm ready, swap out the drive myself. Other World Computing sells solid state drives compatible. It might not be easy for every user, but for those with some computer experience, it is a fairly easy swap. Then I can install a faster solid state drive, when the more acceptable capacity drives come down a bit in price. You might also choose to do the swap yourself because you can then put the hard drive that was originally in the machine, into an external enclosure, and use it as an external drive for backup. Of course, any damage you cause to the machine would not be covered under warranty. Therefore, if you have any concern, you might want to see if you can special order from Apple online, or in many situations, you will find the standard hard drive to be acceptable.After the processor advancement, Thunderbolt is the other great new technology included in this revision to the MacBook Pro. Thunderbolt looks like the Mini Displayport that was already included on the MacBook Pros. Indeed, it will still function perfectly as a Mini Displayport, for connecting an external display. However, Thunderbolt is more importantly a new interface to connect external devices in the future, such as, external hard drives, HD camcorders, and perhaps even iPads, iPods, or iPhones someday. Data would then transfer many times faster to and from these devices than it does currently. These devices were not available at the time of the MacBook Pro's launch, but we have already heard that external drives should be available later this year with Thunderbolt connectivity.iSight camera has been upgraded to HD resolution and Face Time pre-installed on the computer. This gives you the ability to video chat, easily, with other Macs and notably, iPhone 4s and the newest iPod Touch with front facing camera.The consumer software you expect to be included by Apple is once again here. The latest version of Mac OS X Snow Leopard (operating system), iLIfe 11 including iPhoto, Garageband, iMovie, iDVD, and iWeb is all here. OS X always includes Safari web browser, iTunes, and Mail applications too. The average user would be good to go out of the box. You might pick up Microsoft Office for your office document needs, or simply purchase Apple's iWork applications (Pages, Numbers, and Keynote) from new Mac App Store on your computer.The new MacBooK Pros, thanks to Sandy Bridge technology are fast. They will save you time, when using processor intensive applications. Time in business, saves people money and frustration. The average consumer might see less gains with this update as physically the MacBook Pro has retained it identical appearance, size, and weight. Nevertheless, under the unibody, improvements have certainly occurred which result in a much faster notebook. The fact that these 15-inch and 17-inch models now include Quad Core Processors standard is really extraordinary. This is putting recent top of the line desktop performance, into a sleek and attractive Mac Notebook. A breakthrough. Recommended Product!
+	This system performs as any other similarly rated system. It is fast and very nice, but nothing to be elated about.The PC performed as expected, fast.  I do wish the hard drive was 7200RPM, but quite honestly you don't really notice any PC being 5400RPM when doing "normal" activities.Videos played flawlessly, both from online streaming and from the Blu-Ray and DVD playerAudio was very good and loud.  I have heard slightly better audio from Samsung PCs, but this audio was nothing to be disappointed about.  I just had to boost the high end treble a little and it was the way I liked it to sound.  I annoyed my wife with plenty of music.The display was only decent.  Not spectacular.  I was really hoping it would be viewable from all angles, but like almost every laptop out there, when you sit close and the screen is display is angled away from you, even a little, then your display is a little more difficult to read and colors and contrast become muddied.  If you back away a meter, then the display looks fine.  I had just hoped that I would not have the muddying with vertical angles that I always encounter with laptops...The best part is the removable mouse pad!  You just pop it out and can use it from a few meters away to move the mouse around on the screen.  There is a special button on the mouse to switch to media-entertainment for audio or to switch to video.  It lets you fast-forward/rewind or skip to the next/prior songs or to select from a list of music that it catalogs for your from your hard drive (personally, I find cataloging my hard drive's media an annoying feature, what if I have embarassing vids of myself that I don't want displayed on the media menu?!!)It is large, and a little heavy, as you'd expect, but totally portable; I have no problems toting it around at all.It did *not* heat up excessively as I've encountered with other laptops that are processing hard.The first day's use did encounter some pausing of the system at times, which is quite normal as MS Windows builds new profiles, files, catalogs new things, etc. mostly related to initial use and setup, but after that first day it then ran quite smoothly.Again, this was not a super fast system as I'd over-anticipated it'd be, but it was still quite good.  ESPECIALLY for this price range for this sized screen!Note that this battery IS NOT REMOVABLE!  Well, unless you want to void your warranty and CAREFULLY open the case to get it out.  I hate when companies do this non-removable battery crap... Batteries only last 3 to 5 years!!!  And, if you're on the road, it's sometimes nice to purchase, charge up, and have a 2nd battery to swap out when you lack an outlet in your area (ex. my needing to still work a bit while camping or on the beach).You won't find another 18" at this price, that's for sure... shoot, most 17" comparables cost more than this 18" model and offer nothing over this one's specifications and performance.I suggest getting an SSD (solid state drive) for this system, by the way, or a hybrid SSD 7200RPM drive... The SSD will give you longer battery life and better performance over the 5400RPM.
-	Who ever heard of a computer that doesn't have a CD / DVD drive??? Anyway, this one is going back. The positive note is that we only wasted an hour and a half. But now I have a very disappointed child. And she has a mad mama.
+	Think of this as a portable desktop unit rather than an light on the fly laptop.  I am not a gamer.  I travel a lot to other cities where I need a large screen for Autocad and sketchup sessions.  This is a heavy, robust machine.  Once I'm at my destination I set up for days at a time so I'm not really lugging it around everywhere I go.  I have other solutions for that.  It has performed exceptionally well and trouble free right out of the box.  It is very fast at handling intense graphics as you might expect.  You can also expect to pay for what you get.  I don't care.  This is a working tool.  To be perfectly crass, If my computer is down then I'm not making money.  I am, so far, personally delighted with this purchase and can recommend it to others.
-	I see all these other great features reviewers are touting, but just take a second and look for all the issues folks are having with wireless. If the wireless doesn't work, it's a PIECE OF JUNK! Especially since it's a "tablet"/ hybrid- isn't that why we buy these things? I bought this brand new, Feb 2014, it had windows 8.1 installed, and the wireless adapter doesn't work. I've heard all sorts of reasons, none of them make sense, and no one's solutions help. Add to the fact that I have this major issue, the fact that their customer service sucks! Hours on the phone, each time I had to go over all the details (my name, issue, what we've tried- don't they keep track of this stuff so I don't have to waste any more of my time??), then I feel like I'm getting advice on what to do from a child sitting in front of a manual. I can read the manual myself, thanks. This has been the biggest headache of a purchase EVER. I will never buy from this company again.Oh, and also- that high resolution screen you're paying big bucks for? Most apps are not compatible with it so I am unable to read most text (or type, or use the touch screen) in Quickbooks 2014, Photoshop, task bars in IE, even Lenovo's own Rescue Me window. Apparently this "known issue" is the fault of the app developers for not upgrading their products to be compatible with this high screen resolution. I would say the fault is on Lenovo for developing a product that is not compatible with these well known, much used programs! Changing the resolution settings only helps with some (NOT the Quickbooks Pro I bought this POS to run). And that "work around" again means degrading the product you spent so much hard earned money on. UGH! What a scam!
+	I ordered 2 of these computers for my kids for Christmas. I had a problem with one of them but even over the holidays WolVol quickly responded and fixed the issues. My kids love them!!! Great price, great product!!! I'm considering getting another one in the near future.
-	A sorry excuse for a computer.  So much hypersensitivity with the mouse pad that I no longer had any control as to which websites I visited - the computer would suddenly alternate between this webpage and that webpage with no input from me whatsoever.  And when I tried to call customer service to get some input on how to tone down the mouse pad sensitivity, I got someone from India who answered the call - I guess HP thought it was too expensive to hire an American for minimum wage - gotta pay someone 10 cents an hour because anything more than that will take too much profit from the top guys.  I will be taking this garbage back to the store ASAP tomorrow and getting a different brand.  Can't wait.
-	It is tough to say whether the problem is with the new Windows 8 or with the laptop, or how they interact. But. I have never ever had a laptop that was this broken right out of the bag. Constant system crashes, apps don't work, the mouse locks up, applications like firefox lock up for extended periods. Keep in mind, this is brand new, so the problem isn't a virus or system bloat. The laptop and OS arrive broken and incredibly slow.
+	I love this PC. The spec's aren't good, but after installing Windows 8 on it, I got what I wanted, a quick, cheap, lightweight and super portable PC to get me out of any hurry. Of course it won't run a lot of really demanding software, but it get's the job done.For the next buyer, consider buying the one with the touchscreen. If the touchscreen it's not for you, then this is the one.
+	I purchased this machine because it has a DB-9 serial port that I need to accomplish my work.It arrived in less packaging than I expected but with no obvious damage. It has performed without error since I opened the box. I use a suite of software that other machines have not been able to utilize and it runs all without issue or complaint. The case is in like new condition something i did not expect from a refurbish.I have no complaints or issues with this machine and would recommend it and the service that refurbished it to all who would ask.
+	Let me start by saying that I've been using PCs my whole life and I am now 17.  I decided to buy a Macbook Pro for college because I am going two years before I would have actually gone to college.  I was torn between the 15 inch and 13 inch.  I decided on the 15 inch because I do a lot of programming, mostly for fun, but I'm also on a robotics team, because I'm a Physics major.  I decided on the 15 inch model and I'm very happy that I did.  The screen size is perfect for extended periods of use while programming.  The free software on the Mac store called xCode is a great application.I've used PCs all of my life and the Mac OS is head over heels better than all of the Windows OS versions.  Although, Windows 7 is a much closer competitor.Parallels Desktop 7 allows you to run Windows 7 on your Mac also, this adds the best of both worlds.  Mac's killer OS and Windows' programs.Pros:Multitasking is AMAZING ON THE MAC!!!  I love it, Mac OS Lion is great in the ways of multitasking.It is extremely fast.The screen size is perfect.The Mac App Store is great.The keypad is backlit.Trackpad has amazing sensitivity.The battery life is good.Cons:It gets a bit hot on the bottom if it doesn't get proper ventilation.Glossy screen, but for me it isn't that bad.The fact that there is an App Store creates so many possibilities for the future of the Mac.  It also adds so many things you can do in the way of note taking, applications that help you brainstorm for writing papers.  It has been a big help with my 5 page essays.I would definitely recommend this for anybody who likes to program because the screen size is perfect for extended periods of use.  This is a great computer.  It would be even better if you have an iPad or iPhone.  If you have either of those than I would strongly suggest you get a Macbook because of the application compatibility.  This is a great computer and the pros heavily outweigh the cons.  The heat only happens if you have it suffocated by your lap.  This is a great computer and you should definitely get it for college, or any other work related things.
+	This computer is so easy to use ,its amazing .from the moment you open the box , the computer is ready to GO ???? Fabulous
+	I bought this from a store locally to replace a laptop from 2007.  So far it has been able to handle any middle of the road game (Think Sims3, Lego: LOTR) I've thrown at it.
+	Can't go wrong with the 15" Macbook Pro.  Enough power for photo and movie editing and great overall OS that makes using a computer fun again!
+	I've used Macs on and off before out of necessity and to be honest I was never really impressed with the user experience since it was so strange. Now, with more regular use, it's not so strange.Here are some thoughts in no particular order:1. The first thing I noticed was that the Mac experience is a very curated one. Whereas someone with a handle on Windows will be flying around the OS in no time, manipulating files at will and changing settings, your options are far more limited on a Mac. Sometimes you bounce into limits due to ignorance and other times because they are real limits.For example, full-screen windows are still a pain. Maximizing windows does not automatically produce the effect it does on a Windows PC. You still have to drag the bottom right corner of the application to make it full-sized. I still, however, have been unable to figure out how to change the system font size. Beware, it's tiny--and I'm not so old.2. Multitouch is very, very useful; but on the other hand I do miss Aerosnap. Two-finger scrolling does away with the mockery that is the scrollbar on a regular laptop.3. This thing is built solidly. You realize this when you subsequently handle other laptops. The "brick" is a bit odd (I have seen this shape on older Macs) but that's just a matter of personal opinion.The magnetically attached cord seems like a good idea.4. "It just works": There may be some truth to this. I plugged in two different printers (one with a scan function) and if you've ever had to deal with HP and their drivers on Windows you'd be shocked. They just worked--full-featured and all. No need to download anything.5. This thing gets hot sometimes--too hot to put on your lap.6. Flipping through files is a bit more awkward than on Windows. I'm still trying to figure this out.7. Installing applications is sometimes confusing--but I guess I will learn; although there does not seem to be a standard procedure.8. The battery takes a long time to charge and a long time to discharge (compare to other laptops I have used). You get a lot of time on the battery.This is all I can remember for now.I would buy another Mac if possible because of the sturdiness. The OS takes a little getting used to.Will I ever "go back"?Well, I never "left". I will say that things have been encouraging so far--including Safari (the browser I was not initially impressed with--being more partial to Chrome). I still do use Windows PCs and I like the way they encourage tinkering etc. I am sold on the idea of Apple laptops as far as durability goes. Maybe in the future I might buy other Apple products.Lastly, I am considering the OSX Lion upgrade later this year after all the kinks have been worked out.
+	With the new look and feel (Windows 8), me and my family need time to learn and leverage all of the functionality this offers.
+	I love this laptop.  Since I started using it, it makes my Windows based work laptop seem outdated and cumbersome.
+	Ordering the Macbook pro on Amazon was a good decision. The price was fair or let me say the best on the market. Received it the day it was scheduled to be delivered....Love the service.
+	This is a great product. I had a 10+ year Macbook pro and finally wore it out. This one is beautiful and slimmer. I have had no issues with this laptop and just love it.Highly recommend it.
+	Originally, I was going to buy a Dell XPS 15 but eventually canceled my order and bought this Macbook Pro 2.2 ghz 15" macbook pro. I'm definitely glad I made this decision. I haven't had any problems with my macbook so far and even though it doesn't have the best resolution (it's only 1440x900), it is good enough. I really like the option to install Windows 7 (through the Bootcamp program which comes with the Mac OS X). It allows me to run Windows programs that I need to use for my classes and I still have the option to use Snow Leopard). It definitely is worth the $2000 price tag.If you haven't used a mac before, it definitely is does not take much to become familiar with the Mac OS. I had little trouble learning how the Mac worked and I've been using PCs my whole life until now. I doubt I will be going back to a PC anytime soon.
+	is not that quick as I picture, even when I haven't installed all the programs I need. Is a beautifull laptop
+	Quite simply stunning.  I am a filmmaker and videographer that edits my own material, and freelances for other companies.  This laptop allows me to take my craft anywhere I want to go.  The video graphics processor is stellar and the quad core i7 lets me do everything faster.  I wish the rpms were a little higher, but I haven't noticed a problem yet.  Bravo Apple!  I can't wait to see what you add to your notebooks next.
-	I am old school and the apps touch  didnot work for me.  I need the key board like my desk top.
+	The screen is perfect... I love this Mac because is perfect for my work as a producer and musician.... The quality is incredible...
+	I have been using this new VAIO for the last few weeks and it is very well built.  I read a bunch of reviews and message boards to see what I was getting and have not been disappointed. I bought this to compliment a desktop computer I recently purchased with an i7 processor and the i5 in the Sony is no slouch. It handles everything very well and gives me about 4-5 hours of battery life with a few tweaks to the screen brightness (and turning off the CD burner when on battery power).I was a bit concerned about the keyboard layout since I have never used a "chicklet" style keyboard, but I think I type better on it than I do on most other keyboards, it feels so natural. The screen is very bright but just a touch reflective in certain light, but then nearly every laptop today is the same way.  I think the only compliant I have is that I couldn't get it in black, but the silver finish actually looks pretty good.I've had no issues with my computer whatsoever, wifi is blazing fast, bluetooth is seamless, card readers are automatic, etc.  Some have mentioned issues with sound, that can be resolved with a driver update from Sony, and mine updated automatically on the first update so I never experienced the issue.  All in all, I paid as much for this as I did for my desktop, but it was worth every penny...I might just give this one to my wife and get a black one once that is released. This is my first VAIO, but definitely not my last...VAIO's for everyone in my house from now on.Oh and the wireless streaming of audio/video to the TV is pretty nice also. I compared it against the quality of the HDMI out port on the laptop and it was very close (tested using streaming video, there may be differences streaming other videos, haven't tested). The only downside of the wireless streaming to the TV is that the cursor lags on the TV so when you move the cursor, you have to wait a second before you see it move on the TV screen, but I mainly use it to watch streaming MLB games on the 52" screen and it has been flawless.So I rate this 5 stars since it has lived up to my expectations in exceeded them in some cases. Like I said, this is my first VAIO, but it won't be my last, this laptop made me a fan.
-	I really thought that this laptop would work well with my simple needs.  It did not.  One simple thing I needed from it was to play music from the Classical Archives.  It works well with my desktop and my iPad 1.  This computer cannot play a 3 minute track without stopping for "buffering" at least twice.  I felt like I was back in 2003, not 2013.  I tried to play the music via the music tile.  It routed me through Bing which was incompatible with the Classical Archives.  I was told to get Flash.  When I clicked for it, I was told that if I had Windows 8 I have Flash installed.  That plus a huge list of other things that I could try, told me not to waste my time on this computer.  I returned it the next day.  I have a paid subscription to the Classical Archives. Why does Bing have to insinuate itself between me and what I've paid for.Windows 8 is a ridiculous program.  However, I have enough experience with Windows to work my way through its smokescreens.  The apps create layers of junk between intelligent computer users and what they want.
+	I am 12 and my parents got me this for Christmas. It is my first laptop. My fsmily is a PC family but I think this laptop is awesome. Looks great, easy to use, fast, battery last me almost 7 hours. Great computer
-	3 days after getting it the software license expired. So now I can't use it unless I spend another $200 for new software.
+	This is my third Macbook Pro. I have loved every single one. I have used PC's for over 13 years and I must say the change to the Mac OS X has been the best I have ever made. Apple's products are built to last. I use this laptop every day and I must say it never skips a single beat. It was tricky using the new filing system with my old external hard drives but I discovered driver called NTFS-3G so I didn't have to reformat any of them and lose my data. Overall I am happy to have purchased my new baby of systems.The product is sleek and grabs your attention.The backlit keyboard is beautiful and wipes away clean every time.Its hard to get any type of smudge on the casing.One thing i do wish was that the screen came with a standard matte finish (antiglare) instead of the glossy display. It leads to major eyestrain if you are working on something outdoors.Overall a solid product!
+	I've used a pretty wide variety of both PCs and Macs, both for personal use and for work. I've used them for gaming, development, and run-of-the-mill tasks. However, my last two machines (three counting this one) were all Macs. I'm still a believer in the PC for hardcore desktop gaming, but as far as laptops go I'm pretty much sold on Apple. Why? Quite simply, Mac laptops are just a lot less fuss. They don't break down or exhibit weird quirks as often as PC notebooks, generally last longer on battery power, and take up less space. For my latest machine, I decided to splurge a bit and get something that can actually play games- fully intending to take advantage of Boot Camp to run the loads of Windows titles I usually play on my monster desktop gaming rig. The 15" 2011 Pro with 1 GB video was the obvious choice: not so big I can't carry it around, yet with enough muscle to run anything in my library. Was it worth the huge price tag? In a word: yes.Pros:Case design is superior, not just elegant but functional as well. It's actually somewhat water resistant (don't ask) and very easy to clean. The form factor is slim and handy- easy to carry around.Hardware layout is well thought out, and design is excellent. Speakers are positioned so the sound is crisp, almost as if you had externals. Camera is sharp. Trackpad is huge and very responsive.Mac OS X is still the best OS out there. I must say, Windows 7 is a whole lot closer than any other previous incarnation of that franchise, but OS X still has it beat in many ways: no defragging, doesn't degrade over time (especially when used for software development), more stable, boots up and shuts down faster, and generally speaking more intuitive in UI layout. You'll also have a lot less to worry about as far as malware and spyware are concerned.Screen quality is great, and the backlighting for both the display and keyboard are excellent. Note: I strongly recommend paying the extra for the high-res 1680x1050 display upgrade, unless you're always going to have your machine hooked up to an external display. It is totally worth it. Second note: if you do get this upgrade, don't bother with the anti-glare, as it's equally totally NOT worth it (you can get a third party stick-on that does the same for a lot less, and is removable).Has enough power for pretty much anything. RAM/hard drive are easily upgradeable- buy it yourself and install it yourself; it's about as hard as loading VHS cassettes. This model straight out of the box can run most current games on max settings.Dual boot is easy to set up. I'm running Win 7 64 alongside Snow Leopard for gaming purposes. Boot camp sets up all the drivers with little fuss. The only issues I've seen are that the graphics card switching doesn't work on Windows, which eats up battery a lot faster, and right clicking with the trackpad is a bit awkward. The latter is easily solved by hooking up a 2-button mouse.Magsafe is awesome. I'd probably be out a few dozen machines from tripping over the cable if not for this simple yet brilliant feature.Battery life is great. It doesn't usually last for 7 hrs as advertised; 5 hrs is more typical when doing various tasks. However, even that is huge compared to most similarly specced laptops.For a laptop of this size with this power, it's really light.Apple's customer support is top-notch. If you're in the US their stores are pretty much everywhere, and you can get same-day repair service in most cases. Try doing that with Dell or HP sometime...Cons:The mini displayport/Thunderbolt connector means you'll need an adapter for pretty much every different video device you hook up. They're a bit awkward to hook up and can get bulky if you have enough of them.If you run 3-D intensive apps like most games the big video card turns on, and it runs pretty darn hot. When the fans kick in, it gets pretty loud.Compared to some older unibody platforms, it's harder to get at the innards. You have to unscrew the whole bottom plate and remove it to even access the battery. For most users, though, this shouldn't be too big a deal.It's considerably more expensive than a similarly specced Windows laptop.Doesn't have a blu-ray drive, if you care. Most Windows machines in this price range do.Is this machine for everyone? Probably not if due to the price alone, but I've found less to complain about than just about every other laptop I've owned. I'm still a fan of the regular MacBook for non-gaming/coding tasks due to its smaller form factor, lower cost, and lighter weight. However, it doesn't have the power to do anything more serious than video playback. If that's all you're going to do and ease of transport is a priority, then go for it. If you're planning on replacing a desktop or want some serious mobile power, then the Pro is a better choice.
+	best companion till today. have no complains so far. Delivery was on time, nothing missing, No problems with the device. Just excellent
-	This products says it is new but its not true it come in a sealed box but inside was the computer all with scratches, no plastic protective at all. The charger its not the original charger because its bigger than the female in the computer. That’s a fraud . I’m in Venezuela so its very disappointing because how I can send that piece of crap to you without pay a lot of money? This is really bad and it’s the first time happen something like that in Amazon, I had done many bought in your site and always where perfect, perfect packaging perfect products. How could you resolve this problem? I need a very fast solution.
-	stay away from Toshiba computers,toshiba will not honor their warranty! my computer is six weeks old and it had a problem with the bios, needed a password, Toshiba said its not covered under warranty that I would have to pay to get the password reset.
+	i bought this laptop looking for something that would be able to do a lot for the price. when i got the laptop i started testing it out right away everything i threw at it wouldn't slow it down at all. i have plated assassins creed: brotherhood, GTA: IV, minecraft, and bioshock infinite at default settings with no lag at all and 60 fps the only time i has frame rate problems was when i tried recording gameplay using fraps which was too much for the processor to handle. as with the wifi it does seem slower than my old laptop its fast enough that it doesn't bother me but for you internet speed junkies a $20 usb wifi card can fix that. 4 stars for speed/gaming capabilities -1 star for slower wifi
-	After months of trying to get connected, including downloading and installing patches from Sony, Sony admitted that there is a known issue with Windows 8 and some kinds of routers, but will not issue a refund. I have asked Amazon to help, and will report back.Very nice machine to use in every other respect, gorgeous to look at, and weighs almost nothing, but since the wifi doesn't work on mine (as on many of them apparently), it is a dud. After I had bought it, I found that this issue being complained about in many communities, and yet Sony are still selling it.
-	Awesome ultrabook, but the wireless problems experienced by numerous customers including myself are UNACCEPTABLE.Tried to install new driver released 7/17 but not sure if it actually worked because there are no instructions and the install is not at all intuitive.  Have tried fixes recommended by others, but Internet still cuts in/out constantly.Am NOT returning this laptop because it was enough trouble and waiting just to get it in the first place. I'll buy an external wifi adapter if I have to (which would be ridiculous).Asus - get it fixed ASAP before everybody sees these reviews and I'll change my rating!UPDATE 7/22/12:I'm returning this.  Still haven't had any luck with wireless even after assistance from both Asus and Charter (my ISP).  Then, something new happened that made me even madder: The unit shut down unexpectedly.  Really??? This is a $1300 computer.  I'm never buying Asus again.  Their customer support was worthless and they obviously have some serious issues if other so many posters have really had to go through 2 or 3 of these before getting a fully functional unit.  Ridiculous.
+	In May my dad bought me a Mac Book Pro for my birthday. I was a little wary at first never having really used a Mac before, but today I can easily say that I'm happy with it. I'm not particularly computer savvy (and I won't pretend otherwise) so the computer is more than likely capable of far more than I use it for, but it does everything I want very well. Perhaps my favorite thing is the quick start up time, from turning my computer on it literally takes less than half a minute to get full speed. My only real complaint or observation is that the area just above the keyboard can get very hot with extended use. Great laptop.
-	I purchased this item and immediately noticed it had no latch! no magnet, and no way to keep it shut. Knowing this would be a problem I went to return it at bestbuy and they wanted a 15% restocking fee so I ended up keeping it. God what a mistake that was, I was on my way to class, I'm a college student and I have a lot of paperwork mind you, and I went to open my laptop and the screen was scratched, because apparently a cd got wedged in between the screen and the keyboard! - I called sony and asked for a replacement screen and they said that this was an outside of warranty issue. Heres my problem with this, I spent all this money on a laptop, only to realize that it didn't come with a latch! even after the salesperson sold it to me telling me it had a way "some how" to latch, and then after the first year of owning it, keep in mind my screen is now scratched... the hinges have come loose! - so stuff gets in the computer even more now... This computer would be great, if sony didn't have such a crappy warranty policy about replacing a damaged product, clearly caused by an idiot engineer that DIDN'T want to put a latch on my laptop! Thanks for nothing guys...
-	I hate acer labtop. The battery and battery charger have very poor quality and will be damage less than one year
+	Pros: Excellent overall package.Classy understated aesthetics, with a nice brushed aluminum finish.Solid construction, very rigid for it's size. Seems slimmer and smaller than you'd think for an 18.4" screen.Keyboard ergonomics are good, keys are well spaced and have a nice tactile feedback.The removable touch-pad works well and is actually more than a novelty. It works in both normal and landscape orientation.System stays cool and quiet during normal use, and only gets a bit louder and warmer when running games.Speakers are surprisingly good, for a laptop mind you...The Hard Drive is formatted as just one partition (Yay!).Came pre-installed with Windows 7 Ultimate!? Not advertised as such, but thanks!Has a minimum of "bloatware". Took me about an hour to get everything the way I like it.Pretty much everything you could want in a "desktop replacement". An outstanding value for this role. There is nothing it can't do, truly a Jack of All Trades.Cons: Just a little shy in the memory dept. 1333mhz, or at least the option to upgrade would have been nice.The video card is not top-of-the-pile, but it is a nice mid-level card with good battery and thermal performance.The hard drive really shoulda been a 7200RPM. This machine has some serious horsepower but it somewhat hamstrung by it's slowish (but spacious!) hard drive.Other Thoughts: I have owned many laptops over the last 20 years, this is the best one yet. I use it for CAD, 3D Scanning, 3D Printing, Office Apps, Internet, Games, Videos, etc... While not the absolute best at any one of them, it excels at all of them.I would have paid another $200 for a better Hard Drive and Video Card.
+	Was really surprised with the deal on this laptop. First off the hard drive was more then 500GB which was nice! The multitasking and overclocking handles so well. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to purchase a high power laptop for a very reasonable price. Use for gaming and it handles all high settings with ease!
-	I have a lots of problems with this computer, it gets very warm and i have to put it off, because when this happens does not works.I am not able to go to a mac store because i am in Johnson vermont. I want to know what  can i do.Thank you
+	Bought this as a present for the wife after we got our tax return last year. I was going to buy it at Best buy but since it was $50 cheaper on amazon plus free shipping and no tax, I decided to get it on here. We have had this MacBook Pro for over a year now and we haven't had one problem with it. It still works like it did from day one. I love Apple products and will never go back to a PC. Yeah you pay more up front for a MacBook over another laptop with windows, but you aren't having to replace it every 2-3 years. I bet we will have this Pro for 10 years and still not have anything go wrong with it. I highly recommend getting it.
-	Do yourself a favor and stay away from Sony laptops and notebooks. I have been a SONY fan for ages, but this time they let me down to the extent that I'll never buy Sony again. I bought a Sony Vaio VGN FZ series and after 15 months the motherboard completely broke. It just shut off with no warning and I tried to get help from Sony but they have the worst techinical support in the USA; the only thing they do (after waiting several minutes on the phone for someone to take your call) is say "I am sorry for your inconvenience" or "send your laptop to the Service Center". I live in Virginia and their proposal was me to send the laptop to San Diego, CA!!!!! and I would have to run with all costs (including shipping) plus they told tha it would be more than 500 dollars to repair a laptop that costs 980 dollars brand new!!!!  I just gave up and wiil be definitely getting a new one; however, this time I am going to go for a Dell or HP because now I realize the importance of a good technical support.
+	I order used laptop and this one was great than I expected. Good looking and perfect inside. That was good choice.
-	I bought 2 f these for Christmas gifts for my granddaughters.  The black one never would connect to the Internet and the red one only connects when and if it wants to. we have even had them looked at by other people and they can not get them to connect either.
+	I switched from a windows computer to this Macbook Pro and love it. It has a learning curve as it is very different from the windows operating system, but there are good tutorials to help.  The quality of the machine is leaps and bounds over any computer I have ever bought. Some of the software is not so great...like I Bank, But most of my favoriteprograms I can use on the Mac.  Fast processor and user friendly set up.
+	I've been a power Mac user since its introduction in 1984, and have owned various portable and desktop configurations since then. Frequently, you will see major leaps in desktop performance, but it is rare to see dramatic improvements with laptops (you typically see 25-50% improvements). But I have to say, in all the Mac laptops I've owned since my very first PowerBook G4, this is the most dramatic leap in performance I've ever seen. Not only is it 2.8x FASTER than my mid-2009 2.66GHz Core2-Duo 15" MacBook Pro, it is slightly faster than my 2008 2.8GHz dual-quad-core MacPro!I bought my 2011 MacBook Pro (2.3GHz quad-core i7, 15" high-res screen) as an upgrade from my mid-2009 15" unibody MacBook Pro.  I wasn't expecting to be LITERALLY blown away by the raw computing and graphics performance of this update. I have run every standard benchmark suite in comparison not only with my 2009 MBPro, but also against my 2008 dual 2.8GHz quad-core Intel Xeon "Harpertown" MacPro. And to my surprise, this little wonder beats BOTH machines in CPU and graphics performance. Imagine carrying a laptop with true desktop power. My real-world tests (iMovie, Aperture, Photoshop and Nikon Capture NX) simply validate the benchmark results.Here's what my tests reveal:- Geekbench: 10450 (vs. 3722 for 2009 MBPro vs. 9533 for 2008 MacPro)- Cinebench 11 CPU: 5.56 (vs. 1.53 for 2009 MBPro vs. 5.76 for 2008 MacPro)- Cinebench 11 GPU: 36.38 (vs. 13.77 for 2009 MBPro/nVidia vs. 26.51 for 2008 MacPro/ATI 5770)Now THAT is impressive!Even though the Intel "SandyBridge" core i7 processor in this Mac is advertised as quad-core, each core supports 2 simultaneous threads (8 operations), which you can literally see when running Cinebench. If your computing needs don't support multiple cores, the i7 can bump the speed of a single core up to 3.4GHz (TurboBoost) as well.To truly match/replace your desktop environment, you'll need to replace the built-in hard drive with an SSD, because 2.5" hard disks, even in 7200rpm configurations, are much slower than their 3.5" desktop counterparts. I bought my SSD through OWC, and I'm seeing anywhere from 3-40x(!) faster performance for I/O intensive operations such as booting, working with VMWare/Parallels virtual machines, and processing large files (images, video, etc). It is simply the best investment you can make, if you can afford it.Beyond the raw power, there are a number of incremental improvements over the 2009 model:- integrated Intel 3000 graphics, and ATI Radeon 6750M (dedicated graphics with 1GB VRAM)- 1.33GHz memory backplane, supporting up to 16GB of RAM through third-party modules- new Thunderbolt interface using the Mini DisplayPort connector (super-fast 10Gbps interconnect for up to 6 devices, although no Thunderbolt devices are available yet)- Mini DisplayPort supports digital audio and video on a single cable (including HDMI with suitable third-party adapters)- higher-resolution FaceTime camera- SD slot now supports SDXC- updated optical drive (ingest mechanism is less finicky for me)- better battery lifeThe high-resolution screen in this model REALLY makes a difference over the standard screen (which I had on my 2009 model). The 1680x1050 resolution is the same as my older 21" Apple Cinema Display. I was afraid the higher resolution would make it harder to read (the text is smaller), but the brightness and wide-angle visibility makes this one of the best displays you can get in a laptop form factor. If you work in heavily-lit or outdoor environments, you might want to consider the anti-glare (matte) screen which is available in Apple's build-to-order configurations. Both dual and mirrored display configurations are possible - simultaneously supporting full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an external display, both at millions of color. Interestingly, in my configuration, I was only able to get an external HDMI display to operate on the high-performance discrete GPU only.Another pleasant surprise for me was the battery life of this new 2011 model. Even with all that processing power, I'm consistently getting 6-7 hours of usable life (lightweight not heavy work). One big tip for saving battery life is to install the freeware gfxCardStatus utility, which lets you choose integrated only (much lower power), automatic, or discrete/ATI graphics. Apple's own Energy Saver system preference only lets you choose between automatic or discrete. And when you're running on the battery, this can be problematic because simply launching some programs (eg. PhotoShop) can force the discrete adapter. Like earlier designs, the battery is built into the unit and cannot be swapped or user-replaced. In practical use, I don't find this to be a problem because I'm getting the same extended runtime that I got on earlier MacBook Pros with 2 battery swaps.Rounding out the compliment of ports (on the left side only) is Gb ethernet, FireWire 800, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio out and audio in (both supporting analog and digital/TOSlink connectors). If there is any weakness, it would be nice to have a right-side USB port, or at least enough separation between the USB ports to not force you to use a short USB dongle cable with your 3G wireless card (if you want to use both ports).As with Apple's other MacBook Pros, this model is built on their "unibody" construction, where the main case is crafted from a single piece of aluminum. This makes the laptop amazingly rigid, and also allows it to be lighter weight, thinner, and better at dissipating heat than more traditional laptop designs. Apple makes it easy to upgrade the memory or hard drive (you just need a fine #00 phillips screwdriver to remove the screws on the bottom plate).One last note on this MacBook Pro - Apple bundles a special build of OS X 10.6.6 which you will want to immediately upgrade to 10.6.7 using Apple's Software Update mechanism. (You can't apply the 10.6.7 combo updater since this version of 10.6.6 is later than the standard build). The "OS X 10.6.7 Update for Early 2011 MacBook Pro" includes an important fix for the discrete graphics processor under heavy workloads.For those of you (like me) who still have older PowerPC software that hasn't been updated (Quicken!), this will most likely be the last generation of Apple notebooks to run on OS X 10.6.x "Snow Leopard". The next release of OS X 10.7 ("Lion") has removed support for running PowerPC applications (Rosetta). This alone was worth me upgrading to this model.
-	Computers bought between June 26, 2009, and January 31, 2010 were supposed to be given a free upgrade to Windows 7. The purpose of this arrangement was to encourage people to buy computers right away rather than having them wait for the release of the new operating system.Sony now says that it will only provide the upgrade for "selected" models, and I'm out of luck. I will not buy another computer from Sony. You can learn a lot about a company by how they treat people who already bought their products. Don't be stupid. Stay away from Sony.
+	When I was shopping for a laptop, I wanted something larger than 13" without breaking the bank. When I came across this Acer, I was pretty surprised. Price was great, screen size was good and the form factor was surprisingly impressive for the price. After receiving it, I'm still happy with my choice. The laptop feels very well built and the keyboard is very easy to type on. The lower end Pentium processor is still capable when compared to an i3. The only gripes I have are the screen resolution and the trackpad. The resolution of the screen is very low so everything is very large and sometimes things don't look quite right. I'm getting used to it already but it's worth pointing out. The trackpad isn't great either as it's somewhat inaccurate and sensitive but for a lower end laptop, you take what you get.Overall, I am happy with V5. After some getting used to, it's a great cheap laptop and I'd recommend it to anyone.
+	it is a good product in thinkpad series, the only drawback is lack of bluetooth. In a word, it is the high-end product in X series of thinkpad.
-	Straight out of the box the keyboard was defective: The "d" , "backspace" and "delete" key did not register.Sent back after confirming with Asustek of the faulty keyboard.
-	I couldn't believe it. All of a sudden the wifi network adapter "disappeared". Resetting to factory settings and re-installing the network driver did not make a difference because the network drive wasn't even showing up. It is a hardware issue. Will change my review once Amazon replaces my unit. Other than that, I am sorely disappointed that Asus would let a few bad ones slip under quality control.UPDATE:I felt like explaining in more detail what I did.My wireless network adapter had suddenly disappeared - the Wifi status icon on the bottom right turned into the ethernet status icon. I looked for it through the drivers and the laptop had a message saying network driver not installed. Shutting it down, restarting it - nothing easy was working. I downloaded the driver from the Asus website through another computer and copied it over to the Asus, but after installation, it was still saying that there wasn't a driver. My unit was defective albeit I might be in the lower percentile of owning a lemon.
+	I am not a big fan of Apple products and definitely not favorable to its business model, but I do recognize a great product when I see one. This notebook and the OS are just a great choice.
-	This is the first laptop that I purchased from Amazon and am very disappointed. First of all, the battery does not hold the charge, and secondly the vendor said that there is nothing he can do as he claimed that it was tested and found that the battery held it's charge for more than five minutes. I can't return it because it did not come with any warranty and the vendor did not offer other solutions. I am not comfortable buying another laptop from Amazon or recommending others to do.
+	This machine is a beast for the money.  Loads of RAM and spacious hard drive, laser-quick I5 Ivy Bridge (new technology) processor, backlit keyboard, touch screen, and much, much more.  Incredibly slim and sleek-looking, and easy setup out of the box.Like some other users, I had an issue with Wi-Fi drops out of the box, but a quick update of my Wi-Fi driver completely cured this issue.  I've had the machine for over a month, and have had zero other functionality issues.If you're looking for a monster of a budget laptop, I've done all the research for you.  This is your baby...
+	Very, very good, must people that buy a mac will not repent of doing this. I talked with a friend that work on the informatics sector of office depot, and he told me that the best brands( that most do not have problems) are three: apple, asus and lenovo.He told that, if you can afford, buy apple's products. they have best material than the other one's and will last more.Apple MacBook Pro MD313LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION)
-	I purchased this computer in March 2009.  First of all, it's over priced, you should get at least 120gb hard drive!  Half the space is already gone before it's delivered to your door.  The screen is pretty small, it's really hard to read at times, you can increase the screen size on Windows Explorer but that makes it hard to navigate through the pages. Secondly, I can never use it for an extended amount of time because it freezes. I have to shut it down and reboot !  I haven't loaded anything on it because there isn't room so I'm not taking up any space.  It also crashes and reboots on its own, I'll get some kind of crazy blue screen.  Also, regardless of where I am, when I'm using the internet, it decides to disconnect or give me a limited connectivity messages. Lastly and worst of all, the screen cracked!  Not sure if the dog or one of the kids stepped on it but I opened the screen and it looks cracked with broken pixels.  Called Sony, because I figured it would still be under warranty and was told it's not covered!  Had the same thing happen with my Dell computer and they fixed it with no problem, no questions asked!  Then, these people at Sony had the nerve to tell me that a new screen would cost around $600!!! That's over half of what I paid for this piece of garbage!  Oh well, you live and learn.  Don't buy anything because it's "CUTE".  That's really the only reason I did.  I guess I'll buy one of those $400 netbooks!
-	My school bought these for the teachers. I've had it for two weeks. The screen will not turn on after being in sleep/hibernate/shut down. Eventually it will come on after 3-4 forced shut downs using the power button. It already needs to be sent back for repairs.
+	I started shopping for a laptop, mostly for use as a college student for notes, looking stuff up, etc.I was looking for something cheap, small and lightweight, with hardware that would run Linux. This little unit fit the bill perfectly.This particular model includes Ubuntu out of the box, but I am not really into the pure Ubuntu experience. So I installed my favorite lightweight Distro which is based on Ubuntu 14.04LTS called "Linux Lite" in 64-bit (if you have not tried it you would be surprised how awesome it is). I tested windows 7 first for fun and it works pretty well on this thing, but opted to run it in VirtualBox with Linux Lite as the host, just in case I absolutely need it for something. All the hardware worked out of the box in Linux Lite.This thing is not a powerful beast like a full sized laptop might be. Since it easy fits into the category of a "netbook" it is, in a sense, a stripped down version of a laptop. There is no optical drive, installs must be done with other means such as USB. As a whole it seems like sturdy construction, the fan is quiet, the charger is much smaller in size and more discrete than the bigger laptop "powerpack" I am used to. Which helps make it more mobile and has decent length at about 8 feet (just a guess). Real world battery life is about 4 hours. I am sure this thing will serve me well for years to come.Notes: I find that it helps to set the touchpad to "disable while typing", which deactivates the pad for a set amount of time after a key stroke (default is 2 seconds). Otherwise your typing will get interrupted when you accidentally rub the touchpad and click on something. The hard drive is removable and it would be a great idea to drop in an SSD drive. Something I would like to do eventually.
-	after less than 6 month using the lap top is not charging i leave in Panama and have not found a place to cover my warranty and fix the unit
+	Beautiful Macbook Pro that has an i7 processor with 4GB of RAM at purchase.  If you are looking to get a MacBook Pro with a DVD this is a great model to get.  This model is hard to find new and you can get a used one at about half of the original cost when it was new and usually in good shape. With a MacBook Pro and 4GB of RAM is like running a Windows laptop with 8-12 GB of RAM, Macs are that effective with memory utilization and processor turbo boost.  If you plan on running intense programs add at least 8GB of RAM. Nice extras like the lit Apple, back-lit keyboard, aluminum body, track pad gestures and the chicklet keyboard are awesome.  Where Macs really shine is battery life which is nearly double that if a windows laptop.
+	This laptop is a step in the right direction for Apple, for the most part. Everything on it sings with speed and versatility. The only issue I found with this is that the speakers are definitely quieter than the non-unibody laptops (which was my last laptop). This is a shame because I use my speakers quite a bit and have to have them turned up all the way all the time, and that's often not loud enough for me.
+	Macbook Air----------  More screen (1440x900 v 1280x800)  Sexier, more portable (less weight, thinner)  Better keyboard input (sharp edges on the Pro's frame cut into the wrist over extended periods)Macbook Pro-----------  Better display with wider color gamut and viewing angle (IPS panel v TN)  Rugged (search for faint lines on Air, Air is susceptible to keyboard imprints, Pro's display protected by glass)  CPU is faster with a larger cache (Air is good and more than fast enough for day to day things, so is the iPad)  Cooler and quieter (Air gets noisy on moderate load)  Upgradable SSD or HDD (lottery SSD with Air)  Upgrade to 8GB RAM for cheap  Gigabit LAN  DVD drive is convertible to a 2nd drive or SSDI really wanted to get the Air but the screen was disappointing unless you look at it directly (perpendicular). I would kill for the 1440x900 screen though! And the noise while watching youtube or anything moderately cpu intensive is unbearable on the Air but much more tolerable than a run of the mill PC laptop. I've been spoiled by the unbeatable quality of the Macbook Pro line and when it came time to upgrade I stayed with it. I'm sure an Air is in my future but not yet.
+	The computer is great for the price!! i just dont like how to update macs you have to buy every software leading up to the newest one instead of just going straight to the new one.
+	The best in personal computing. It is the perfect combination of elegance in design and computing power. It is the best.
+	The other reviewers went into the technical specs & construction, so I'll go with some real life experiences. I've been using this computer for over a week now and wanted to wait till everything was connected and all software tried out before commenting.My configuration is with the hi-res anti-glare screen & upgraded to 8 gigs of memory. The screen is breathtakingly sharp and the colors intense. If you are thinking of buying the computer, the extra $100 is definitely worth it for the hi-res option. Glossy or matte is a religious preference, so that won't be covered. The resolution is the same as a 20" cinema display but in a 15" package.Speed - yes! A 3d file I tried to render on my old MBP would have taken 24 hours. On this computer, it took less than one hour including anti-aliasing. This is a combination of the increased processor ability, better graphics card and more memory. How much upgrading you do will depend on the software you are using. If you are doing processor-intensive graphics, don't even hesitate before buying. In Photoshop, it opened a 34 MB RAW image immediately and a variety of filters were then applied, each without any processing delay.The cons:  - battery life has been overstated. I've been using the computer for two hours now - only doing web browsing and email, and the battery is almost half drained. Other days when running Parallels, games or graphics programs, it goes down a lot quicker. This isn't a surprise, but you need to know you can't fly cross country using the computer all day - it's not an iPad.  - display issues. There is a problem being the first one out the gate with new hardware, and I am having issues when connecting to an external monitor. Apple engineering is already working on it, and it may only be some configurations, so you may or may not want to wait before this is figured out.Migrating from an old Mac - this is the first time I've done this using the Migration Assistant software. Wow. Instead of spending a whole day recreating my customizations, they were all there the minute the computer started up. Word of warning - before you do this make sure you can connect both computers via Firewire (you'll need an adapter if the old one is still firewire 400), because it took 5 hours for the migration to happen over ethernet. Worth the wait - everything is there: the screen saver, browser history, preferences, etc. Even the printer worked without having to search for and install new drivers.In spite of the cons, I still give this computer 5 stars because one is a given (battery) and I'm sure the other will be worked out.
-	Good computer and nice feel to it but the 16GB of RAM and 1T Hard drive (+128 flash drive) was a horrible. Very slow, constant crashing and after 3 months caught fire. Waiting for it to be solved but worst experience in 10 years.
+	Review updated, see below.Overall this is without a doubt the fastest laptop I have ever used.  Period.  My complaints start with the fact that if you use either Chrome or Firefox and set the brightness of the display to between 50-60% you will not get the advertised battery time.  I struggle to get 4 hours, usually I get about 3 instead of the 7ish that Apple advertises.  Another complaint I have is with the heat this laptop puts off, it is hot enough to be at the maximum of what Intel recommends for the i7.  I have recorded processor temperatures above 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  For a $2,200 laptop this is unacceptable.  Old Pentium 4 Dells from a decade ago ran cooler.  The case seems to be designed with visual aesthetics in mind, not good thermal management.  As for these two issues I have spoken on the Phone with Apple support and supposedly high temperatures are within "normal" and the battery life can very.My last major complaint is with the Thunderbolt port, all it does is cause problems.  I have a Samsung Syncmaster that works occasionally with this computer.  Another problem is my MacBook seems to think that I have a monitor hooked up even when there is nothing plugged in, whatever program I used on the external monitor does not show up on the laptop screen.  Even after multiple restarts and shutdown/power on cycles I still have this problem.With all of the little nagging issues I and numerous other users have had, read the apple forums, I can't recommend that someone spend over $2K on this laptop.  Until there are driver updates to fix all of the issues me and loads of other users have experienced I would say hold off on the purchase.If Apple issues updates I will gladly change my review but until they admit there are problems with cooling and Thunderbolt I can't give this laptop a higher score.Apple please fix these issues, they seem to be very widespread!Update 1: Apparently I have angered the Apple gods because I now have a keyboard that will not backlight even in a dark room, really Apple?Update 2: Another issue I can add to my growing list of irritations with this laptop.  It takes anywhere between 45 seconds to over a minute and a half for my laptop to go to sleep.  Either closing the lid or using the keyboard shortcut to sleep the computer results in a lot of waiting.  It is quicker to shut the computer down and restart it than it is to sleep it for me.Update 3: After using this laptop for about 2 weeks now I am overall satisfied with my purchase.  There are still a few issues I have but unfortunately the heat issue seems to be a problem across all MacBook Pros.  For some reason the screen and keyboard dimmer issues I had are now gone.  Sleeping still takes a while but its tolerable.I will say this laptop is FAST.  Rendering 720p video is near real time.  If you have a 10 minute video expect the render time to be about 10 minutes.If you can splurge get the SSD option, its the one thing I am doing as soon as the price of a 500 gig SSD comes down to a reasonable amount.  Except for the heat this laptop puts off I am very happy with my purchase.  The overall experience is very good.  On a minor note I am pleasantly surprise at how much I enjoy typing on the keyboard, coming from a ThinkPad keyboard I have VERY high standards for my laptop keyboard, and while not as good as a ThinkPad the Pro's keyboard is still very nice.If you need to do video editing, photo work, or any graphic design and you need to be mobile this is the laptop for you!
+	I don't think there's too much I need to say about this one. It's super powerful and it looks amazing. I bought the Corsair 8 Gb RAM upgrade and put those in before I even turned my MacBook Pro on for the first time. Worked perfectly. The only problem I ran into was that one of the fans was making some awful noise. A couple of taps to the fan got it back in place and running totally silently.I also set up Boot Camp and loaded Windows 7 Pro 64 Bit. It runs great. Make sure you install the video drivers before you install the Boot Camp drivers. Otherwise the extra features available in the Radeon tools won't work.
+	I really love this one. I'm not seeing any problem so far. I hope this will last so i won't go back to other brands. For first time user, it would be a little challenging but worth it.
+	I've been using Macintosh computers since 1996, and in 2011 I decided maybe it was time to get with the "Windows world" and purchase a PC. As you can probably assume by this review, I did not hold on to that PC too long. I decided to go back to Mac with the brand new MacBook Pro--and words cannot explain how much BETTER Apple's OSX operating is to Windows 7.I can honestly say, I'm a better person with my MacBook Pro. I'd be willing to bet that any Windows user who buys one of these laptops will NEVER voluntarily go back to using a PC ever again.Everything is incredibly simple, the screen is gorgeous, the keyboard has quiet-touch keys that light up which make typing fun. Start up time is incredibly fast. I'd say it takes less than 40 seconds from me pressing the power key to being on the internet.iPhones, iPods, wireless printers, etc., all hook up with ease with this computer. Heck, I even love the sound it makes when it closes.So no, this is not me being an Apple "fanboy" as they call it. I've worked with Mac's for over 15 years, have an iPhone, and now this, but it's just me simply recognizing that Apple's products are SUPERIOR to Microsoft's.Those commercials of "go Mac and you'll never go back" are 100% true. I could not have put my money towards a better piece of equipment.
+	This is my second Macbook and although I haven't had a replacement for my first in about two years, this Pro feels like I've been reunited with an old and well loved friend.  This baby is a sleek and slim number that hardly gets warm or makes noise. Its a thing of beauty. The multitouch trackpad is an exceptional invention. It makes surfing the web effortless! On a whole, this macbook performs well and I'm very impressed with the attention Apple has paid to every single detail -it shows in the seamless way it works and feel and I'm sure every user will notice it. I'm glad I returned to a familiar friend...can't believe I waited so long.
-	Ordered this a month ago. Used it for about 3 weeks without any issue. Then recently, the battery would not charge unless plugged in. Whenever the cord was unplugged the laptop shutdown and when plugged in showed battery at 11% but did not charge.Luckily Amazon's 30 day return policy was still valid so product return was accepted.
+	I recently upgraded my four year old MacBook Pro for this one and I couldn't be happier with my decision. It was difficult to spend the $1700 but in the end well worth it. PC's do not compare to Mac's, especially when you work in a created environment. If you are having hesitation like I did, don't worry you will be more then satisfied with this product.
+	I was completely amazing at how quickly this laptop was mailed out to me! It arrived days before the first possible date it was supposed to arrive! It came with a super nice backpak case and gaming mouse. This computer is the nicest I have ever had and works like a dream!
-	I needed a Windows computer for one application I use that stopped running on Windows xp. I bought this computer rather than buy a copy of parallels or VMware Fusion and windows. The computer is very slow. It suffers from random reboots and lock ups. And it is very difficult to use. Even though it has an hdmi port, I cannot get it to work properly with my projector.I had to install the Winx key and god mode in order to get it to work properly at all. even when I get that, it doesn't compare to a MacBook Air. I can't stand windows Metro style. The lack of a backlit keyboard is unfortunate. The computer is hard to open requiring two hands.
-	I purchased this laptop in March 2009. It was fast, had good video and sound--for a month, then we had video problems. The faulty hard drive and defective LCD cable harness were replaced in warranty. Today, 11/02/2010, it would not power up. I will have to pay $425 for a motherboard replacement. When it worked, it worked well, but to have to replace the main board, hard drive and video cable within two years is ridiculus. The reliability of this model is very questionable.
-	I purchased this laptop with high hopes.  During the few weeks that it did work properly, it was an amazing laptop.  The first problem I had was intermittently the laptop will not power on.  I had the charger connected and when I hit the power button, nothing.  I found that if I held the laptop upright, and press the power button, it would turn on.  Possibly something loose inside the laptop?  At this point I already called Amazon for a replacement.  Shortly after several of the keys on the keyboard would not work.  Maybe the power button was intermittently not registering when I press it?My replacement was initially placed on August 13.  My est. shipping date was August 24th-25th.  Longer than I expected since I received my purchased within days and Amazon website showed it in stock.  When my item did not arrive on the 24th, I called Amazon again, they assured me that my item would be there by the 25th.  After my item did not arrive by the 25th, I called amazon once again.  The associate who picked up could not give me a est date of arrival.  I was told I would have an answer within 24 hours.  24 hours passed by and still no update, I called once again and that was when they told me it would be there September 5th.  At this point I just wanted a refund.The next part of my frustration is that I purchased gift cards to buy this item.  Over $1000.00 in gift cards.  I requested a refund after finding out there will be another 2 weeks delay.  I called Amazon requesting a refund.  They told me policy is that the refund can only be in the original form.  I purchased the gift cards with the purpose of buying this high end laptop.  There is nothing else on the market equivalent to this laptop.  With such a poor product and nothing else on the market equivalent, I have no use for $1000.00 Amazon gift card.  I requested a refund in a different form and was told they can "try" but policy states gift cards can only be refunded in a form of a gift card.I am very disappointed with this product and Amazon.
-	within a month of purchasing this the fan stopped working. it's made of cheap plastic. i bought this for my little brother to use in his freshman year in HS, big mistake. I'd advise spending more money on a higher quality PC.
-	i got a lemon...trying to return for an exchange currently. I already have one of these in the family and ts perfect, the one i have now has technical issues with its cpu usage and flash drive components,,,,glitchy
-	The macbook we received was faulty. I tried to return it but there was a long process involved and I had to use it for classes. Now, I'm stuck with a macbook that has a CD-drive that doesn't work and a bad battery.
+	Over a year if daily use and still going strong.  Cannot wait to upgrade the RAM soon to 16GB.  Love APPLE
-	I purchased an FW laptop in November 2008 and the keyboard failed in August 2009.  Service was responsive and replaced it.  In January 2010., keyboard failed again and Sony will not cover since the computer is "out of warranty".  I have another brand that is still working after 8 years.  One year life is outrageous!
-	Our school purchased a Latitude laptop for every teacher in our school this year. They are very useful if you are looking for a paper weight or need to flatten out student paintings from art class. Otherwise, they are useless. All of them crash at least once a day, and I mean with the ominous blue screen featuring the ominous fatal error message. Several crash in lieu of a screen saver-- students come in for a class, you teach for an hour and return to the computer to complete you work and, Voila!, the lover blue screened fatal error message. This has happened this morning six times already and it is only 10:26 am. I recommend you spend your money elsewhere, Perhaps in decorative paper weights with the blue bird of happiness instead of this lap top with the blue screen of despair.
+	I did a lot of research before deciding on this laptop. I admit I was leary about buying a refurbished one but thought it would be better than a used one. With limited funds it was a great price. I love my laptop. I'm so happy I purchased it!
+	My laptop needs are very basic.  I just wanted something light to carry around the house and write on.  For that reason, I can't attest to the wireless or playing of DVD's.  However, for what I need, this laptop is perfect.I can lift the laptop in one hand.  It's only a couple lbs.For the expense, this laptop is very well-designed.  I looked at a cheaper model, but the sleek design of the Asus and the feel of the keyboard make the extra expenditure well worth it.The one thing to note.  If the track pad is sluggish for you, go into the settings.  I'm a light touch, barely sliding my fingers on the pad and expecting a response.  At first the track pad wasn't performing to my expectations.  The sensitivity was set to the lowest settings, so I moved it up. Since then it's perfect.Like others, I also experience the track ball jump, but I'd rather have a sensitive track pad.  Overall, I'm extremely happy with this laptop.
-	My Sony sits in a closet.  Not sure why I keep it.  During the warranty period, AND the extended warranty periodit spent probably more time in their hands then mine.  Almost each and every part of this computer broke.  Whenthe power source (that is connected to the MOTHER BOARD) broke for the 3rd time I was actually thankful because itnow classified as a lemon. IT doesn't matter if every part of the internal workings of your computer goes, or it needs sent in 8 times in 18 months it can only be a lemon if one thing breaks 3 times.  Which sucked because I was racking up 2x on a few things...but never a third time. Then the power source finally did a 3rd.  Wow I now classify as a lemon.  Only they beat me on the warranty.  On the outside of your computer, there is a hole that the power source will plug into.  My model of the VAIO had a tiny piece of circular plastic inside that hole. CompUSA tech the very first time it broke (and this was a geek from heaven tech...so nice and wonderful) used a tweezer to help my power cord stay connected and download me all my stuff on it before it went for repair. This never affected the computer or any other repair from hard drives to fans, to key boards to DVD player to Ram and so on.It was an outside part of the computer house.  In fact Sony kept repairing it & I kept going without a computer.  A warranty only last so long. When the external power supply finally racked up a 3rd time they wouldn't honor it, because it required giving me a new computer.  They claimed the broken little ring of plastic was damage to the computer even if it was on the outside of the computer & doesn't have ANYTHING to do with the repair at all. They had been repairing this computer all along for every part over and over again...until they did their best to find any reason possible to NOT honor a warranty. I suppose that I could have gone against Comp USA.  I almost did.  But this was such BULL I wasn't going to involve the tech that had been so decent to me in two years, in a corporate mess that was unfair & wrong on Sony's part.  Your probably thinking I just was abusive to computers.  WRONG.  I've owned them since they weighed a ton, no one visioned a lap top in life and I design graphic frames.  I have my own geek corner.  With 3 systems in a row.  I know how to be with a computer.  In fact I have one that works perfect I bought during this fiasco on my long desk set up a few feet from me.  Don't trust them in customer care.  They will look for every possible loop hole to back out of their warranty if it costs them.  This was beyond ridiculous that I had to buy another system to have a computer that was a lap top since I picked the VAIO.  They are so wrong as a corporation.  I don't want to see anyone, who ever you are get taken the way I did...if your unlucky & get a lemon shipped to you. They exist...lemons.  Which is fine but you don't have to do a person in if they were the unlucky one to have that shipped to their house. Please dear lord...get another brand.  Yes it works great.  I remember that.  But your in a lotto...if you get their lemon on the shelf & god help you then dealing with them
-	Buyer Beware!!! Damaged Goods.Purchased a Dell laptop from Petersen Wireless Laptops- Laptop was poorly packaged and arrived damaged (dented in corner)- WIFI did not work- Tried to return the product, but have not heard back from the supplier after leaving multiple voice messages and sending email.Don't waste your time and money with this vendor.
-	I bought this laptop and was super excited about it. However, once it arrived, I turned it on and got very disappointed. Namely, the laptop did not boot!!! It just kept reporting errors such as "No bootable devices", "Boot failed", "Your PC needs to be repaired",, "Error code: 0xc0000185" etc. Unfortunately, it turns out I am not the first person to experience such an issue with Lenovo laptops:[...]Anyway, I am definitely returning this product right away. Under no circumstances will I call the customer service to discuss an ISSUE with a BRAND NEW laptop!NB: Please don't get discouraged reading my review. Keep in mind that your Lenovo laptop might actually work. You never know until you buy one :) Good luck!
-	Bought this laptop for $600.00 dollars, I thought man what a deal!!!! But when it arrived, I turned it on only to find that the keyboard didn't work...and not to mention that the mouse on the screen runs all over the screen in circles all by itself!!! Buyers beware...don't go the cheap route and buy a used laptop, spend the extra cash and get it brand new when it's covered under warranty!!!
+	I purchased this macbook about 2 or so weeks ago and it arrived a few hours ago. At first I thought it was broken because it wouldnt turn on but that ended up being a mistake on my end(it wasnt charged).I got this for my mom for christmas because she's been needing to keep in contact with my brother. I honestly love this thing, i might even buy one for myself. Thank you so much. Excellent excellent excellent product, i would recommend this to everyone.
+	I have to go on doing the connect wifi several times each time i want to connect it everything else is fine
+	For many years i was a PC guy until I purchased this through Amazon.  My main reason in buying this was for my musical DJ setup being that today's dj uses mp3/mp4.  Let me tell you that this MBP rocks! Its superfast and superpowerful.  I am never going back to PC.  The included apps like Garageband and Photobooth are fun to use! The built in camera is cool too.  The beautiful thing about ordering through Amazon (and living in California) is there is no tax! Thats like a $200 savings! On top of that, shipping was free and it actually arrived to me 1 day before the actual estimated delivery date! good job Amazon/UPS!
-	Updated to 8.1, then the problems started,  HP could not fix, promised many callbacks,never got one. On start up ,CAPS  on when they were not.. Got good at removing battery& recovering..
-	HP no longer uses parts that will last for a person that uses a computer for more then internet use and at that not on a daily basis. Fans are not lasting.Motherboards are not lasting and the list goes on. Stick with dell or lenovo until hp decides to produce reliable products again. Search out replacement,keyboard,screen and such and you will see the staggering amount that are sold daily
+	Considering that technology is changing everyday, for this laptop to be over a year old it performs and looks extremely well. The aluminum unibody design is amazing as well as the screen real-estate; I was accustomed to a 15.4 inch display, so the transition was seamless. A very great product and with the right upgrades, can be "future-proofed" for up to 3 or 4 years, in my opinion.
+	This 13 inch version of the MAC Book Pro is the first lap top I have owned.  I like it, although it's a bit heavy to carry around with me.  Right now the programs I am using are TExt Edit, for a book I am writing, and the digital output via heaphone link, so I can listen using an outboard digital to analog converter, to my I tunes and other music I have put on the MAC Book Pro.  I plan on adding a music server besides I tunes, so I can use the lap top as a digital transport for higher resolution audio, to be fed to my reciver, that is able to decode higher sampling rates than those available through I-tunes. I"m kind of an audiophile.  So I will be using the Mac Book Pro not only to write with, but also as a component in a high end audio system.
-	This is the most I've ever spent on a piece of junk. I bought the dual graphics model and was hoping that it'd be a quality machine for the amount of money I paid for it. I did my research and even went to the store to check it out multiple times before I made my purchase. It looks well built and runs fast enough for daily use. But underneath that black brushed aluminum-looking shell, it's a piece of garbage. This is my 2nd one since Lenovo had to replace my 1st. Now with the 2nd, I have a bunch of issues with it that are completely different than the 1st. Hmm... no way Lenovo could send me 2 defective pieces of junk. The 1st Y510p I had spent over 72 cumulative hours on the phone with Lenovo tech support and even allowed them to access my machine so they could "troubleshoot" it. After realizing each tech support person just did the same exact thing as the last, I got fed up and asked to send it in for repairs. I sent it in twice and it came back with the same issue every time. After the second, I wanted a refund, but was told that I could only get 60% of my purchase amount refunded and I would have to return the machine on my cost. So, I chose the other option to receive a replacement machine and... SURPRISE... another piece of junk. Now I have to waste weeks of my life getting this one fixed and probably will end up just throwing it out the window.LENOVO HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. THEY WILL NOT MAKE THINGS RIGHT. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND LENOVO. BUYER BEWARE.
-	The laptop is very fast and light, but unfortunately the WiFi does not work.  Most of the time when coming out of sleep mode or restarting, it will not re-connect to a network.  Says "connection time-out" yet it shows good signal strength.  All of my Windows and Android devices still have no problems connecting.  Also tried Apple's software patch, released after others have had the same issue - I think the patch actually made the problem worse because now it won't connect at all.Now returning it because a laptop is pretty much useless without WiFi.  Plus, can get a Windows machine that actually works for 1/2 the price.  May not look as nice or be as smooth, but need to have WiFi.Also - as I prepared to return it, I learned that a SSD cannot be securely erased.  Recommend testing all features of this laptop before saving any passwords/sensitive data...Going to try 1 exchange, but probably my first and last attempt at an Apple laptop.  I expect a premium product if I'm going to pay a premium price.Update - Purchased second laptop, same issue.  This time WiFi will not connect at all.  Again, I have Android, Amazon, an iMac and Windows devices connected to the same router.  Tried loading Apple's patch via disk - didn't fix the laptop.  Recommend DONT BUY until Apple fixes WiFi issue.  Not sure where the positive reviews are coming from.
+	First off this computer feels well built.  It is sturdy, and solid (no cheap feeling plastic or hollow points inside).  The computer is really thin, and looks good.  The OS is very easy to use and was ready to go after I typed in my name and basic info.  The OS found my wireless printer instantly (using Bonjour) and downloaded the HP software without me doing anything (other than going to Print and selecting my Printer).  The screen looks really good, and even though it is not full HD it looks very good.  The DVD drive is nice and sucks disks in when you put the disk in (like the PS3), the only weird thing is that you have to put the disk almost all the way in before it pulls it in.  This model has 2 USB ports, which are good for cables, however, if you are trying to use a flash drive, you may not be able to utilize both ports with the another cable in (depends on your device and equipment).  The power adapter that comes with the computer is really nice, it is magnetic so if you hit the cable it just falls out; the power cable also has a handy pop out hand that ties the cable nicely, so you do not have a bunch of cables hanging out.  The computer does not have a VGA/DVI/HDMI out port, so you have to buy an adapter to use an external monitor, the computer easily recognizes when to use which monitor (when both are open it extends display (unless you specify to clone) or if you close the MacBook Pro the External monitor goes at its native resolution.  I use a 21" HP monitor and it works fine (when extending or External only) at 1080p.OS X is really nice.  It is super easy to use and learn (it takes a while to get use to if you try to do everything like you would in Windows).  The settings are pretty straightforward, and Spotlight search is really good at finding what you need.  the Mail app and Calendar app work well with my Gmail account.  If you are a developer then you will find Xcode very useful (which is free from the App Store), and if you are like me and have a few Windows applications that you have to have, Bootcamp is super easy to setup.  Specify how big a partition to give to Windows, download the Windows Drivers CD file, and then insert the Windows 7 CD.  Write to the proper partition (follow Bootcamp's instructions (download or print before starting)), and then once you are in Windows put the driver CD to get Windows to recognize the hardware.  To boot into Windows in the future hold down Option or Alt (depends on which keyboard you use) at startup (if you get the Apple logo you missed it) and get the boot menu.  Windows works very well in the MacBook Pro and sees 8 Processors (4 Cores, 4 Virtual Cores from the Intel i7).  Windows only seems to use the ATI Graphics card, not the Intel Graphics, because Windows does use the switch graphics card like the Mac does.  Windows can also take advantage of the external display using the adapter (Start + P) to change external display settings in Windows.  Also, when in Mac OS X I see that my battery time remaining (when just surfing the web) usually shows 7.5 hours, as you perform tasks the time remaining automatically changes, to show how much battery you have using the current task. -- Note, this battery is not changeable, you have to have Apple change it (like the iPhone)The computer that I got (from Amazon) came with Lion, so I did not have to upgrade, however, Lion no longer includes the backup disks that were included with previous MacBook Pros.  Because of this you have a recovery partition on the HDD, and you do not get iWeb and iDVD(which would normally be on the iLife disk, so that is sort of disappointing -- you do get iPhoto, iMovie and GarageBand).In the end, this computer is very well built, and should last a long time (since it is very sturdy), the computer is also very powerful and should be beyond adequate for quite some time in the future.  I hope to get a long life out of this computer, and since it can support Mac and Windows it should be able to accomplish everything!  I really like the computer, and hope to have it for some time.  If anything changes I will post it here!
+	Amazing laptop, very happy with this purchase.For a reasonable prize i got a machine strong enough to develop my programs and play a videogame once in a  while. Solid and good product.
-	zenbook goes blank on first day of use.  nothing else to it, it simply shut off cold turkey while i was getting to know it better.  is it the 256 ssd?  anybody else experienced similar?  the rating would have been a solid 4, but now it's next to nothing.  should i return it and get a macbook air instead?  i REALLY do not wish to go the apple route, but...
-	Bought 128GB hard drive model by mistake. My fault. Wanted the 256GB. 128GB just isn't large enough these days. Less than 100 GB's available to use with the recovery files. Only 60GB's available for use after a couple hours on the net and didn't save any files. Strange deal. Solid state drive is neat. Toshiba, HP, Lenovo have ultrabooks out now with 500GB hard drives at $700.00 - $900.00. Not solid state hard drives, but much more practical. 20% "restock charges" to return. Will try to sell this one online for a big loss and get on. Had heard good things about ASUS. Maybe this is just a bad unit? Also, the touchpad is very, very sensitive. The cursor goes all over the place. Makes composing emails and doc's very frustrating to say the least.
-	after I bought the laptop with him there are different strangeness. all movies online and through fleshkarte began to slow down. not possible to see the film properly!! and most importantly, the screen became much darker and does not respond to the color settings.
+	Mike was very open to communicating with me via both email and phone about the computer he was selling. He promptly provided all pertinent information and answered all of the additional questions I had. Perhaps most importantly, the laptop was priced fairly. When I received the laptop - within three days of buying it - I was thrilled with the product. It was exactly as Mike described and in great condition. He even added a few personal touches by setting my name as the username.Apple MacBook Pro MD313LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (OLD VERSION)Next time I am looking for a product like this, I will check with this seller before inquiring about any other products online.Thanks Mike!
+	I wish I had enough time to write the long, detailed review I want to write. It will have to be enough to say that I am more than happy with my Macbook Pro. I had used Windows based laptops and notebooks (Toshiba, Acer) for the last 5 years and I can't see myself going back for anything. This computer is FAST. It is stylish. It's not cheap, but it's durable. When you think of the fact that the first graphing calculators were as expensive as a MacBook Pro (and that during a time when money was worth a lot more) it's not hard to believe that this is worth it.I play COD 4: Modern Warfare and Batman Arkham Asylum on it daily with no glitches or slowdowns. There are Mac versions of all my favorite PC applications (like Skype and Firefox - though I prefer Safari to Firefox) and not surprisingly iTunes WORKS on this machine where it failed on my low RAM Windows PC.I have not been dissapointed with my purchase in the SLIGHTEST. I'm glad I ordered from Amazon and saved myself $100.
-	i hate it with a passion,google already sucks,this chromebook is supposedly always on the latest version and software.i cannot watch my mnetflix,do school or anything,the video and everthing is slow and it never really actually loads a page correctly if at all.i will never buy another chromebook,i will never recommend a chromebook,i do not trust google.i am honestly thinking about deleting all my google accounts and sticking to Microsoft and yahoo.as well as yandex.Google  search is slower than ever google chrome doesn't work its way slower than internet explorer.in my opinion google stock market is going to crash dramaticly.google company needs to shut down there business you guys are all about money and getting as much of the worlds Info.you are taking over everything.you took over youtube,what next stop you have severe privacy issues and a lot of malfunctions in everything you have put out.Give up now please. I hate you google never  again will I ever use any product of yours.u lost a really good customer
-	Dell has had problems with this line of laptops. Although you have many features and seemingly high end components, you will be disappointed with performance.Primarily, you will be very dissatisfied with:- the trackpad pointer, which is erratic and buggy for which Dell has no fixes, nor are any forthcoming- the CD/DVD tray phantom ejection problem, which is also well documented by users on Dell's own customer web site; again no fix forthcoming- loads of adware/Dell-promos which get annoying and will make you wipe your HDD to start fresh.Avoid the Inspiron line altogether. Dell has dropped the ball completely here.Disclaimer: I currently have a higher end Dell Inspiron with a full Core2Duo/250GB/3GB. I have tried to use the Dell/Best Buy Geek Squad coverage, but this is a un-usable perk, since Dell will do nothing except refer you to Best Buy, who will insist on taking the laptop from you for an indeterminate period (last time it was for 2 months, with them saying they couldn't fix it, and provided another faulty replacement). I cannot give up my only PC and send it to limbo! Just what do they expect me to do with all my private and personal data???!!!Again, do yourself a favor and AVOID DELL. If not, then you have only yourself (and Dell) to blame!
+	This is one of the best laptops on the market.  The old canard that it's more expensive than equivalent Windows laptops just isn't true.  You have to dig into the specs of this thing to really make a comparison.  But that's irrelevant, let's talk about the laptop itself.The good* Very nice graphics.  When plugged in you get nice HD video from an AMD 6490M (when you're plugged in) or from an Intel 3000HD when on battery.* Multi touch (well almost) trackpad.  It's missing a couple of things from the huge Magic Trackpad from Apple, but it has everything I can use.  I can really maneuver around the computer with my trackpad.* Brilliant screen, 1440X900, absolutely HD.* OSX 10.7 Lion.  Really the best OSX by far, and amazing what it can do.* Speedy quad-core i7 processor.  My massive Excel spreadsheets recalc fast.  And working with Photoshop and Aperture show no issues whatsoever.  This laptop really can be considered a mobile desktop.* Beautiful aluminum case.  Just makes it feel expensive.  (One note, aluminum does bend easily, so if you're rough with your computer, get one of those protective skins.)* Nice built-in camera for video chatting, Skype or other things.* Easy to upgrade to 8GB memory.  And you can get it for a lot less than Apple charges.Not so good* I'm not a big fan of the speakers.  They don't put out very much sound, even at full blast.  It's kind of hard to watch movies without a headset.* The hard drive is light for the price.  Amazon sells 1TB 2.5" hard drives for a good price, but upgrading the hard drive takes some skill to do it right.Overall, I am very happy with the laptop.  I use it for everything from basic web browsing to photo editing to business work.  I have had a lot of MacBooks, so I guess I'm not only used to them, I know how to get the most of them.  This one is a great one.
-	I bought this computer right before I went to grad school and was deciding between this and a macbook air which were roughly the same price, and I can't tell you how much I regret not buying the Air (or at least some other computer).  Let me preface this by saying that I have bought Asus products for years - this was my 3rd laptop from them and I had also bought a motherboard for a desktop from them.  I never had any serious issues with those purchase so I decided to stick with them for my latest purchase. As you have probably guessed though, it wasn't long before it started having problems.  It stopped charging within a couple of months of buying it.  I contacted their customer service people and found that Asus customer service is especially abysmal - emails from these people were in unbelievably broken English and the things they told me were inconsistent from one rep to the next.  The only thing that was consistent was that they were all of very little help.  Eventually I was told I would just have to buy a new charger from them.  That irritated me but I was desperate, so I did it.  A few months later, guess what - it wasn't charging again.  So I called up the customer service people again and after a lot of back and forth was told to send the computer in.  I did this and a few weeks later they sent it back in exactly the same condition, still not working.  I called them up again and after some more back and forth was told to send it back in.  I did that, and a few weeks later it came back with another new charger and a replaced part.  I just got it back and is working for the time being, but I have very little confidence in it and it has been a huge inconvenience.  I have owned this computer for less than a year and in that time the computer has literally spent months being of no use to me either because it wouldn't turn on/charge or because it was in transit back and forth and back and forth from Asus.On top of this the firmware they have for the touch pad is really awful, and the fit and finish is not as nice as my friend's Macbook Air.  Basically, under close inspection/first hand use, this think is pretty junky compared to the Air as far as I can tell.  In addition to my more major hardware problems, I have a couple dead pixels and the "feet" on the bottom of the computer aren't perfectly aligned such that when I place it on a flat surface there is a slight wobble that can be felt.This most certainly the last Asus product I will ever buy.  My advice for people in my situation in the future would be to go with the Apple not only does it appear to be a better product with better customer support, it's also an American company.  Hope you learn from my mistake!
+	The best laptop ever. I love the touchpad. It's nothing like all the other brand laptops. If your the type of person who likes the top of the line laptop, then you shouldnt hesitate to get an apple MacBook pro. You are wasting your time trying to decide what kind of laptop to choose. Apple is the most innovative, they have the best operating system, they are immune to viruses, and all of the above. The price you pay is well worth each buck. The MacBook pro is a great investment, you can't go wrong with it. If you try other brands, your garuntee to get a virus on it and end up wasting ur investment on it and forced to get a new one. So if your looking for the best quality computer, go with apple.
-	Well, I've had this for 2 years. I was able to play Call of Duty Modern Warfare with no problems. Two months later, my computer starts overheating then shutting off. Anytime I play a game that requires the littlest of effort from the video card, it can't handle it. I've even had this thing shut down from overheating while having it connected to a projector for a presentation to my team.Idle temperatures are way too high and I have even elevated the laptop and put a fan to it to help "cool" it down. Still overheats. And yes, I have shot out all the dust with a compressed air can. Stay away from this. Gateway customer support is a joke. I spent way too much on shipping only to have them send it back after running a version of 3DMark05 once. Did I really just waste my money on having them install a free piece of software that I could have done myself?Only good thing about this computer is that it's relatively quick with basic processes and that it looks cool. Don't even bother having this on your lap because it will be too hot to handle.
+	Our law office uses many computers and I find it necessary to have laptops of various sizes for many reasons.  This is meant to be a semi-portable laptop.
-	I bought an HP Envy 17 less than a year ago.  It crashes constantly, and HP support is so frustrating it is unbelievable.  Make sure you check all the "Automatic Repair Loop" issues online before you purchase ANY Windows 8 HP laptop.  Right now, mine is looping and unusable.  HP support after three calls I have been assured that I will get a call back in two days.  HP service is just the worst.
-	the laptop is inexpensive and has nice features. i know 99.99% of purchasers will be happy with the stock configuration of the unit; however, i'm a computer tinkerer. i seem to constantly upgrade and modify my system to suit my needs. after purchasing this unit, i wanted to upgrade the included mini pci-e wireless card to an intel ultimate-n 6300, to take advantage of the 5ghz network in my home. i discovered the bios has a lockout for hardware changes.  it gets to the bios spash screen and gives  and "unauthorized wireless card detected" error message. after researching, it was discovered that the hardware is locked preventing one from changing the wireless card. The only way i've come across to circumvent this restriction are a series of  hacks to the system bios. i can't think of any realistic reason not to allow an owner to upgrade/modify thier own system. i have never come across this before with other manufacturers, and i would not have purchased if i had known beforehand that the system intentionally prevents me from installing certain upgrades.i wouldn't tolerate not being able to configure my desktop pc, i should have the same freedoms on any laptop/notebook i purchase.
-	What is this "low on memory" thing? i only have one browser open and this is supposed to be a 4gb ram.it keeps closing my browser and sometimes restarting my system all over again. it never stops. it freezes so easily. i am beginning to regret the purchase.
-	The battery was not charging. Computer had scratches and stains. The packaging boxes were filled with dirty old newspaper pieces and looked like junk. Had to return it back.
+	I have to say that I like this old version of the MBP better than the newer ones. The main reasons are that this one is a little thicker, so it doesn't feel flimsy, like the smallest drop could seriously damage it; I like the placement of the USB slots- everything is on one side; and lastly, the superdrive: it's there- on the newer models the superdrive has been removed, so in order to play dvds, which is one of the main reasons that I bought a laptop, you have to spend around $80 to buy an external one.
+	Love it.  Had it almost a year and it's never crashed.  Runs just as fast as when it was new.  Not a single problem.  Can't say that about windows based laptops I've had.  The only drawback is that there is a small learning curve.The price.  The upfront buy was very expensive compared to a laptop.  But when I consider how long this will last vs a laptop and the lack of problems, it became a easy decision.Will NEVER buy a Windows based laptop again!
-	I purchased the Macbook Air 11.6" in July of 2013 and was very excited about it.  I was converting from a PC and loved the machine, at first.  About 7 months after I purchased the laptop the charger stopped working.  I took it inot the ApplE store at Grand Central in NYC, and they informed me that there was extensive corrosive damage to the logic board.  There was no cause for this to happen, and this extent of damage is iexplicable.  Apple informed me that I would have to pay over $750 to fix the machine, despite being covered under warranty.  I am very displeased with this product and considering switching back to a PC.SarahNew York, NY
-	Came in on time and looking great. After a few months I thought I had really gotten a great deal. Just a few days ago the computer started making a loud noise and then just shut off. It hasn't turned on since and I don't have the money to replace it. It is fully charged my computer friend said I will have to dish out money that I don't have to get it fixed. Very unsatisfied. My advice, DON'T buy used and just spend the money to get you a new one.
+	Ok so, there are def more pros then cons, however, IMO, the cons can really break customer/seller relations, for example.Pros:PC came quite fast, quicker than I expected.Came in great working condition, a little wear and tear, but to be expected.Cons:PC was physically dirty, screen was dusty and keys had dirt lodged between them.System had buyers files and folders still on there.So in conclusion, the pros are, the seller was prompt, and the item was as described, the cons are, the visual presentation should really be cleaned up before product is shipped out.
-	We have had this laptop for about 6 months. Since that time we have had to buy two batteries for it because the old ones died. 7 key caps have fallen off, some keys that we rarely, if ever hit, like the equal sign on the keypad. Also the AC adapter has gone bad and I have had it in twice for repairs. Perhaps it is just a lemon, but all I know is my experience. I would recommend another brand.
+	Its nice and powerful machine, only issue that i found is the HDD Speed. If it was an SSD then a lot better. the Screen is crisp and clear.
+	I was debating between the 2012 macbook pro I5 or this older version in I7. i decided to go with the 2011 I7 version because of the processor. With the work i do,video editing, photoshop, n having windows 7 (Parallels) I needed the the highest processor my budget would allow me.I could of went with the 2012 2.9 I7 but it was a little more pricey so i decided on this late 2011 and i don't regret it.Coming from windows pc over 10 years of use, I got tired of buying a new laptop every other year and as much as i baby my laptops, i seem to run them into the ground because of the extensive work i do on them. I believe regular pcs are made to just browse, email and Skype n etc but not made to be power-horses.i owned a hp I5 and this macbook pro runs much fasteri added 16gb ram into this baby and with everything open, photoshop, video editing, multiple windows open and windows 7 open i still have a remaining 6gb running, and no crashing or slowing down. this is a web designer dream computer.i never thought i would go with macs but as they say once you go mac you never go backand the fact you can runs windows on macs makes it more perfect.the only reason why i did not give this 5 stars is because battery life. the battery literally last less than 3 hrs after full charge. im not sure if its because im running so much on it at once, but the battery life is really bad and does not give me 9 hrs as advertised.if you webdesign, use photoshop, video editing n etc def get a macbook pro, you wont regret it!
-	I got it the 5th my mom passed on june 1st  I just opened it it wont boot up or anything pos
-	I am bitterly disappointed by this laptop. Was so excited when this laptop finally came out but it is a major let down. Within the first two weeks the windows key on the keyboard had broken off. I sent it to the ASUS service center and was told it would take 10 working days to fix (standard fix time). 4 weeks later i still did not have my laptop. After numerous calls i finally received my laptop after 5 weeks. I have now had it back in my hands for about 3 weeks and now the up/down and esc keys are not working! Well they work intermittently which is extremely frustrating (as i type this the keys have started to work again). I will be calling ASUS again tomorrow and will be pushing for a refund.  They clearly have major faults with the UX31A.The touch pad although not faulty, is terrible. I could of lived with it if my keyboard was functional but the track pad really is terrible. Moving the cursor tends to highlight random text or click things you have not selected. I have updated the drivers but is still a pain to use (my up/down esc keys have stopped working again).On a positive note the screen is fantastic but with all the other problems i would steer clear of the Asus Zenbooks, unless of course you like poorly manufactured equipment.This is by far the worst computing device i have ever owned! If i could give zero stars i would.
+	This laptop is a beautiful piece of engineering from HP. I am a techy guy/road warrior and I am very picky about laptops. In my opinion this is the only credible alternative, in some ways a better alternative, to the Mac Book Pro. The touch pad is very well done, it is just like Apple's. And unlike Dell touchpads, the software drivers are very well done, they dont suck up background CPU and the two-finger gestures work well. The screen and keyboard are really great. A couple of special features here, there are USB ports on the left and right, to accommodate whichever side you might want to put a mouse on. The is no built in CD/DVD drive, there is one that comes separate, which is fine for me, I pretty much never use a CD/DVD. This saves weight and size. The touch screen is a really nice feature with Windows 8, I wasn't sure if this was really needed on a laptop but Windows 8 works a lot better if you have this. Finally the number keypad is a nice touch if you are doing business work. I mean right down to the fingerprint scanner, the superior "Beats" audio system, this Laptop in my opinion is the best on the market. I've compared in detail with Dell and Sony who really make great machines, but just dont put the package together the way HP does. I mean the little details make the difference, on the Dell the keyboard backlight for example, its uneven across the keyboard, and its not really that bright, here it is just perfect (just like the Mac). And in terms of performance, for the money this machine packs an amazing punch, I'd really suggest 16G of RAM if you can afford it, if you are a power user you will top out and be swapping on an 8G machine. I will report back in 6mos or so on how well this one travels and if anything breaks, but, so far bravo to HP for a really nice job on this sweet machine.
+	I originally hesitated when buying this product.  I am a traveler and I only spend one year in each country before traveling onto the next adventure.  Having something considered "elitist" and very expensive on travels made me a bit nervous of pick pocketing.  Not only that, but it's hard to synch a Mac with other computers and there's no real tech support yet where I'm going next.  So, I ended up buying a different brand of laptop (to remain unnamed) and HATED it.  In it's defense, I think it was a defective model, but still!  So awful and the internet was so slow.  It was pricey too.  Not as pricey as this, but pretty up there.And then I got this... this demigod.Travelers out there, let me tell you, this is the ultimate laptop.  It's skinny, fits well in my backpack, it's lightweight, has a decent battery life (not the best, but certainly decent enough - around 5 hours).  I have the 13".  I know that the Macbook Air is smaller, but it only has 3 hours of battery life, so I opted for this one.  And it's STRONG.  I'm not as worried about it getting broken or damaged because it feels very secure.  (Still... be gentle with it!) I mean, it really is THE ultimate traveling laptop.  There's no getting around it.From the moment I got this awesome device, I could FEEL the difference from the other laptop.  Apple is just on a whole different level.  They keys feel wonderful and the trackpad is easy.  (I still have the wireless mouse, just in case, but I never use it).And any gamers?  I play World of Warcraft and the images are GORGEOUS.  Not to mention there's never any lag.  On the other laptop I briefly had, the lag was awful, and I've experienced lag on my brother's laptop as well.  But on this one?  Never.  It's smooth, uploads quickly and you'll be playing within the hour.  Amazing.All in all, I know it's pricey.  It really is, but it is SO worth it.  The other laptop I had was around 900$.  For 300$ more, this laptop feels like a steal.  They could sell this for 3000$ and get people to buy it.  It really is the next generation.
+	Great for the price. But Windows7 is an over loaded piece of junk. This laptop had 49 programs/processes runny when it came out of the box. No wonder so many people complain about proprietorial machines!!!
+	First, I'm a long time Windows-Based Computer user. This is my first Apple product ever. I have to admit, up until recently I've considered myself an Anti-Apple Crusader! But in my new job, I've got a lot of exposure to Apple's products and the customers feedback has been overwhelming: People love their Apples!! You combine that with life-long series of disappointments, frustrations, freezes, crashes, viruses and 'updates' with each and every "PC" I have come to own or use ( and trust me when I say: I've got my hands on quite a few).It was a 'Green Monday' deal at a nearby Bestbuy store: Apple MacBook Pro 13" for a little over $1000 with 6-18 months Financing. I just couldn't let it pass. And so I got my hands on my first Mac.Urban Myths Versus First-Hand Realities:-----------------------------------------------1) The Only True PC On The Market: We use the abbreviation PC so loosely that we kind of forgot what it stands for: "Personal Computer." So it has nothing to do with a particular OS or hardware manufacturer but rather the combination of both and the overall user's experience. That's being said, and having used my Macbook for  over two months, I'm ready to make a rather bold statement: Mac computers are the only true PC's on the market. Other machines are more less of Windows-Bloated computers!!2) The Mac OS: Mine has Mac OS X v10.7 Lion pre-installed.  I have to admit I was afraid the switch was going to be hard because I knew nothing about Macs. But 3 days into using my MacBook Pro, I fell in love with it!  The Operating System is very user-friendly and ridiculously easy to use/navigate. The following link was a great reference for me: [...]. I also went on YouTube for more advise on how to get the best of my new Mac. And the Apple Rep at the nearby BestBuy store was super helpful. Honestly, by the end of the first week, I was up & running and since, never really needed to ask any questions as to how use my Mac. Oh, one more thing that is worth highlight: settings ("System Preferences") are very visualized & easy to set up & change. Three thumbs up! I know I'll never miss the "Control Panel" on other so-called PC's.3) Superior Build Quality: You get what you pay for. You're paying premium price but you're also getting a premium quality. The Aluminium unibody is an eye and a hand pleaser! The built quality is superb and attention to details is meticulous!4) Great Juice Pack! The MacBook Pro is, hands down, the best battery life laptop out there with 7 hours of rigorous use easy! I can't think of any other laptop that comes close.5) Lack of HDMI port: Simply overrated! All you need is a Mini Display to HDMI adaptor and you're set! It would be nice to have a dedicated HDMI but I don't think it's a deal breaker.6) Blue Ray Drive: Well, it would be nice to have but I don't miss it. Here's why, because I don't like spending $25 on Blue Ray Discs!!7) ClickPad: Once you learn the different gestures you can do with your fingers on the generously spaced ClickPad, you're hooked for life. It makes browsing the Internet a pleasurable experience. It really is flawless.8) WebCam: is standard VGA 1.3 MP that fell short of expectations, especially when compared to the 2.0 MP WebCam found on laptops like my previous Lenovo Edge 14". I have to admit, the difference in video conferencing quality is noticeable. I am not saying it's bad but I surely have seen better and was hoping for more.9) I love the "Dock." It really is the easiest way to access frequently used apps. When you combine it with the "Launchpad" then all of your apps come within reach. The whole platform is optimized for multitasking.10) The First Comprehensive Digital Ecosystem: Apple-branded devices work in a near perfect harmony with each other: iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, Time Capsule and Apple TV. You've got apps for your MacBook, apps for your iPhone, your iPad. You've got all kinds of accessories to personalize & maximize work and play output. It's like being a member of an exclusive club where you get Prime time every time!!Bottom Line:---------------It sure is worth every penny I have invested into buying it. I'm not saying it's perfect. But it sure is the closest you can get to perfection.
+	The guys below or above are crazy, because I have this computer and work awesome. Of course your son's space bar is not gonna work, this is not a gaming computer that is why his space bar is messed up of pressing it too much to jump or to shoot. But overall this computers bring all the features you need to do work, or videos. It offers HDMI many computers do not offer that. Also it offers a cam and that is very helpful for when I have business meetings. In my opinion the only down side of the computer is that it does not have a CD/DVD Drive. I recommend this computer to people that need a computer to do School work or business work. I do not recommend this computer to parents that wants to buy computer for kids because they might use it to play video games and this computer is not gonna work for that.
-	i have purchase this product thinking it would be great. but after 2 months of using, it crashed on me keeps over heating. and i have been asking question about the quality of HP products to some of my friends they told me that don't ever buy HP products they're cheaply made and will not last long. yes the price is cheap but you better off buying a high quality laptop that will last for years. never again buying  HP products.
+	I love this laptop. It plays all my games like BF4, Assassin's Creed IV, and Saints Row IV on medium settings. I bought it for $500, and it gets performance almost comparable to Lenovo's y510p.Pros:-Large touchpad-Great graphics-Decent processor-Good keyboard-GREAT speakers-Number pad-USB 3.0-Great priceCons:-Gets slightly hot during gaming, not even close to an overheat though.-Not much space between arrow keys and normal keyboard-Battery life could be improved, I get 4-5 hours on battery saver mode.Verdict:In my opinion, this is the best gaming laptop you can buy for under $600.
-	Terrible quality design. I take good care of my things, especially my computers, and after only a few months of use the hinge on the screen broke while opening the laptop. Was impossible to open or close after that, and the whole thing always seemed flimsy and liable to break. Fortunately it was under warranty so I was able to get it fixed, although I had to pay to ship it in, which is absurd. Lenovo's faulty, cheap manufacturing caused the problem and my options are to spend $22 to ship it in or $60 to take it into a shop just to look at. I have sold my used Lenovo to be used as a child's computer, and now have switched to an Asus, a brand I highly recommend to anyone looking for an affordable, well-made laptop.
+	First, let's get the WIFI disconnection problems out of the way. No promises, but this is what worked for me and many others:1) Update the WIFI driver to the latest one. Go to us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers to get it. As of this writing, the latest driver is version 10.0.0.225. Install the driver and reboot.2) Then, on your computer, open Network and Sharing > Change Adapter Settings > **WIFI Adapter Properties** > Configure > Power Management > UNcheck **allow the computer to turn off this device to save power** See? You want to stop the PC from turning off your WIFI to "save power."3) Then go to your Battery Settings.....Click Battery icon > More Power Options > Power Saving / Balanced / High performance > Change Plan Settings > Change Advanced Power Settings > **Wireless Adaptor Settings** > Power Saving Mode > on Battery > Change to low or medium power saving (Medium works for most people. I chose Low). Reboot one more time. Done.--------------------------Now the review. I'll update this later if I encounter problems.Pros:* Optical/DVD drive. DVD drives are growing increasingly rare in the "budget" category. Maybe you don't want/need a dvd/cd drive. I do. I think the closest rival to this laptop is probably the HP Envy Touch, and it doesn't have an optical drive.* i5 Processor. This is middle of the road. Not as slow as the i3, not as great at the i7. But the i5 does its job well. And yes, you can game on this, IF you adjust your game's Resolution and Details to Minimum, bringing the fps down. It still renders the play smoothly, example world of warcraft, sims.* Graphics card / Memory. This comes with the Intel HD Graphics 4000 card (update the 4000 card driver when you get this laptop!) - and 128MB of dedicated system memory. Yes, I would definitely prefer an nVidia and more Memory. But, for the money, it can still juggle multiple programs being open at the same time, some CPU intensive. For example, if you're playing a game, you definitely should close all other programs first to free up that Memory. However, let's say your editing videos; in that case, you can manage to have your editing software open as well as other programs and truck along just fine.* More USB ports, including 3.0, and dongles (HDMI/VGA/Ethernet, packaged separately) than I've seen in most laptops under $600.* HD webcam.* HD space. This is 750gb. Some other V5's offer 500gb, yet cost more.Cons:* Battery life. 4 cell is far from stellar. The description says "5 Hours," but don't count on it, unless you're an extremely light user with minimal programs running. With heavy use, it's more like 3.5 hours. I think you could probably find a 6 or 9 cell for this and it would increase your time to 6-7 hours, but I haven't looked for one - yet.* Resolution. 1366 x 768 - max, is not great, at all.. However, the only time I can really see the effect of that low resolution is when I'm pinching to zoom in the browser, it can look somewhat pixelated. However, the desktop and programs UI look great, as do videos and everything else.Ambivalent about:Windows 8. I miss the Windows 7 interface sometimes, because the familiarity of the Start button. I use Stardock Start8, which gives you the option of using the Windows 7 or Windows 8 interface, both.Overall: A+
-	Computer may have worked okay, but never could get the track pad to consistenly work.  If the computer went to sleep the track pad wouldn't work unless it was rebooted.  Sent it back for a different laptop.  Most likely it was a Windows 8 issue, but it isn't asking much for a brand new computer to have basic functions.
-	This $1,400 Ultrabook looks great on paper, but quality control apparently isn't implemented at the ASUS factory.  The Notebook arrived with a non-functioning camera (searching on the Internet, I see others have had the same issue).  After two hours on the phone with ASUS technical support, including a demand that I wipe the machine and reinstall Windows (which I did), they advised me to send the unit in for its first repair--two days after receiving it new!  Shipping a device with defective components and apparently not testing before shipment is not a great way to start a long-term customer relationship, so I'm returning it to Amazon and starting the search all over again.  VERY disappointed.
+	Very satisfied with this powerful computer and stillI feel I got an awesome price for it.Definitely recommended to anyone who wants power/price efficiency.
-	I couldn't be more dissatisfied with this item. I'm not sure where to start. I paid over 400.00 for the computer and thought I got a real bargain and boy was I wrong. Should have known there was a catch. We had it only a few days and it quit working. Taking the sellers word on the condition, I paid to have it looked at and told the tech what I had been told. He thought "a graphics card." The seller knew that it was the motherboard with the graphics card integrated in it because when I told the seller what the tech said, he was very anxious to hear "graphics card" and said, really? The tech ran diagnostics and said it was(Of course it wasn't working, neither was the motherboard), but he didn't have one. I paid to have it shipped to Gateway dealer for repair. I'm starting to lose money at this point with shipping and paying for first tech. Gateway dealer said it's the motherboard with integrated graphics card. "They are obsolete and you can't buy new or refurbished." I paid over 100.00 to that tech up front only to have it shipped back 3 weeks later not repaired. I sent it off again to a tech in Florida and paid 101.00. They said they'd be able to help. More shipping cost, it came back un-fixable. It now has a place on a shelf and won't even turn on. Wow....a few days and several hundred dollars. Told the seller and he was rude, didn't want to do anything. MY FIRST BAD EXPERIENCE WITH AMAZON, Sorry that seller has to ruin it for all the honest people.
+	Bought this as a late Christmas/off-to-graduate-school present for son, who insisted on waiting until the newest model came out. He had never had a Mac before, having been raised on Windows computers. Transition to new operating system happened almost overnight. He bought whatever software he needed to actually work in the Windows world as well as the Mac world, as he does some web development and app programming. He says that the processor speed, video board, disk access (even though only 5400) are incredibly superior to the high-end Dell this laptop replaces. We read the reviews by the Mac-o-philes who complain about reduced battery life and other sub-par aspects, but for someone switching platforms, we have none of the nirvana Macs to compare to. The super-long battery life allows him to work through lengthy classes with having to search for power. He is absolutely in love with this computer, and keeps insisting that I switch too. This one comes highly recommended, from a geek moving from Windows to Mac. One more note: I bought this just as the computer was coming out and watched prices over a number of days before actually buying from Amazon. Amazon consistently had the best total price overall, thanks to low price + no shipping cost + no sales tax.  Glad I bought here.
-	1. Within 6 months,the DVD rom drives stops working. Or it just refuses to finish a DVD movie,regular length movie,I mean. I have only tried watching 2 DVDs on it2. Now, it is about one year since I bought it. The wireless connect to router is falling off. Forget about download anything. In my house, there are 4 other computers connecting to the same router. One of them is 6 year old Sony NGN250?. It is 2GB and very slow. Still, the Sony machine connects to the rounter. But this Dell machine cuts off wireless connection, more and more often.3. I had BestBuy Geek Squard upgrade it to 8GB, the max memory it can handel. I spent $39, because you want to upgrade memory on this machine? Forget about it, because you run huge risk of screwing up your keyboard and other tiny wires. All the other machines I have, HP, Acer, Sony, and Toshiba, you just slide open and slike the new memory stick in. You are done. This Dell computer is becoming a computerized car. It is just so component unfriendly. So anything Dell says about this machine's upgrade potential, you need to seriously think about DIY. I bought it ~$300. Now the labor cost for installing memory is 13% on top of the purchase price.4. Is it really 3GB installed on the original machine? The BestBuy guy rolled his eyes and said he never heard off 3GB. The two sticks being replaced show 1 GB each. Is this a ....fraud case here?Not only my confidence in Dell, but my trust in Dell, is fading. Well, against $300, it is not a really bad waste, but a waste.
-	I wish I'd read more reviews before I purchased my Sony VAIO VPCCW2 series laptop.  I bought it new in February 2010, and now I own a very expensive paperweight.  I paid for diagnostic at an electronics store and was told the motherboard is out. I called Sony customer service, but they wouldn't even address my issues without an additional $49.95 service fee to run diagnostics and troubleshooting on a laptop that won't even boot up.  I use to think paying a little more would get me better quality, but that's not the case at all.  Buyer beware...
+	I have used Windows since Windows ME and I have never tried a Mac. The closest I got to a Mac was in school and I thought they were terrible.Back to 2011, I felt the need to buy a new laptop to replace my existing Windows 7 laptop (i wanted a sandy bridge and faster laptop). I was hesitant at first because of the ridiculous pricing but this macbook pro changed my mind entirely of my perception of macs.The laptop finishes booting up a few seconds quicker than my Acer laptop and the user interface was beautiful in its simplicity. This is the key word here folks: simplicity. Windows involve more menu clicking and finding compared to a Mac. Dont get me started on the screen, WOW! My eyes WILL get used to this when studying. In fact, it will make studying easier because the screen doesnt have dull areas like on my acer. Now the trackpad, it is the best trackpad I have used. You can move on the trackpad and click simultaneously without letting go of your finger. I like the chiclet keys plus the backlighting LED makes it look cool. The side speakers have incredible volume that I actually have to LOWER the volume because it was just too loud! My acer's volume fail in comparison but Acer's laptop have a smaller speaker.Overall:Apple Macbook Pro design is sophisticated, clean, and functional. I feel like a heavy burden has left my shoulder thanks to the nice trackpad, screen resolution and quality, and overall ease of use of Mac's OS X Lion.Apple has converted me from PC's! (Well, for now anyway!)
-	Well, would be a great computer - if it worked....  Ordered the cute little red PC from Sony direct....  Would have been nice if they loaded the operating system on to the computer correctly.  It is hard to imagine how a PC can pass Sony quality control if Windows was not loaded.Sony is going to take 10-14 days to replace it...  I have asked for a refund as I do not want to deal with Sony's poor customer service in the future.Think long and hard about buying a Sony PC...  In this day where you can get a computer basically at your local 7-11, customer service matters as much as the quality of the hardware.  In my case, Sony Customer Service let me down.Jeff Thomson
-	I did not buy this Lenovo G580 computer from Amazon, but I'd like everyone to see this before they buy one.I bought this laptop from local Fry's store, picked it up mainly because of the price. It seemed offered good value. But after one year of usage, I know I was wrong. Here is why.1. It is made of cheap parts. Well, it is cheap, but still works, right?2. It is heavy and ugly, my boy complained all the time.3. It has a bad design flaw. After half a year light usage, the hinge part pops open, it turns out it uses the same tiny screws as the bottom cover, it is not strong enough.4. At 11 months, blue smoke came out of the vent, it is totally toasted5. Their repair service is really really bad. Did not hear anything from them after 3 weeks sending Lenovo the computer for repair, finally called them, find myself talking to someone in India who does not know anything. 2 days later, got a notice they shipped the computer6. The battery shipped back can run only half hour now, not the original battery anymore.7. 2 days later, the AC power adapter retreated into the case, cannot use it anymore.8. Talk to them again, they said it is out of warranty.9. Complained to BBB, but Lenovo refused to replace itSo after one year, this computer is complete dead.  My 2005 Sony Vaio is still working. If I had spent $100 more, I could have picked up a much better computer and still be using it happily.Conclusion:  DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER, DO NOT BUY ANY LENOVO COMPUTERYou will regret if you do.
+	Oh man how can I begin to tell you, LOVE IT, my son hasn't put it down since Friday it's fast and the condition of it was excellent couldn't believe it was used.
+	I got this for my husband who is deployed. It works great and easy to travel with. We were able to link it with my computer and easily transfer anything that he might want on his computer. It is very compact and durable.
+	I am a previous MacBook owner and have always loved Apple products. The updated October 2011 MacBook Pro is definitely a keeper. I am impressed with the Lion software and really enjoy it's features. I am a college student, and I find my MacBook to be very suitable for helping me with my coursework. With the lightweight design and sick computing capabilities, this computer is surly  worth the money!
-	This laptop lasted less than one month. Toshiba makes you pay for the shipping to send it back. I wish I would have gotten something else.What really gets me mad is that I use it for school and now I won't have it for the end of the semester. I now have to fight for a computer in the library and they don't even have the software I need. So I have to write code in notepad and send it in without running it.
+	Delivered exactly as described. This refurbished laptop will do everything I would have expected a new to do at a fraction of the cost.
+	We were XP users and were apprehensive when Microsoft announced they were no longer going to support XP. We researched the market for alternates and selected the Toshiba Satellite E55T-A5320 Ultrabook 15.6" Touch Screen Laptop - 4th Generation largely due to its high rating in Consumer Reports and to Toshiba's fine reputation. We are most satisfied with its performance and the ease of integrating it into our computer needs. The touch screen is the cherry on top of the whipped cream!
+	When I first purchased this computer, I wanted to shoot myself in the foot afterwards. even though it's the best price that you can find anywhere, I was taking a serious plunge. Now that I have it,there are no regrets. This is a great computer and judging by the high quality durability, its going to last me a while. It's sleek and sexy; I feel like a new person because of this computer! If you haven't already converted to mac, I highly recommend you do! I'd buy this again in a heartbeat :)also if your a student, don't forget to get the microsoft windows for mac
-	this lenovo laptop is not user friendly, numeric key pad is not there on side. keys are not soft, I even didnt liked the performance
+	Best laptop or notebook I ever had will not buyAnything else ever & love amazon also Love the Mac book pro A+A+A+
+	For christmas my boyfriend bought me a Mac pro 13.  After going through several HP computers that keep needing the hard drive replaced about once a year we got tired of spending $700 for crap computers.  While I didn't like spending the money for a Mac you have consider the peace of mind you get.  Having my desktop hacked recently and not being able to turn it on it only drove home the fact that you get what you pay for. I love my Mac it is so easy to use I never have a problem with it no more freezing, losing my stuff or having issues period.  I also got my son an iPad to replace his NetBoot which got hacked as well.  My family is now and forever a apple user.  I'm working on getting a Mac desk top for my business although my Mac book pro works great for my business as well. My only complaint is there is no one note for Mac I depend heavily on it to "print" thing off internet without killing trees and as of yet haven't found a program I like as much. To protect my investment in got a speck matte cover which has already saved my Mac from scratches and silicone keyboard cover which I love. I never considered these items with my pc bc I thought they would give out so fast it wouldn't be worth it. Now that I have a com outer that will last for years it's worth it. When I was researching macs I found people saying there 2006 macs still worked fine they just wanted an updated one. That one statement won me over I haven't had a pc work for more than a year much less since 06 says a lot about apple. We have iPhones, iPads, and MacBook  looking to get iMac and mini Mac soon!
-	Arrival, the computer has no sound, never buy! ! ! Is a bad computer. Amazon how do such a thing? ? ? I am a Chinese customer, not replace, but also not back.Only to repair it.
+	This product was bought by my son.  He has not given any feedback on how it is operating.  Maybe when he has used the item for a little while, I can give additional feedback.However, I have a problem with packaging of items - packaging in many instances is far too big and the item(s) may still be daamaged because of shifting within the large box/boxes that ar used to ship sometimes very small items.
+	Love it.I would mention to people that you can't go wrong with the i5 version of this computer. Keep in mind that both the i5 and the i7 versions of the 13", both have dual-cores. Once I came across that in my research, getting the much cheaper i5 was a no- brainer.This computer is also a beast. It's fast, powerful and has plenty of HD space to store plenty of Virtual Machines and other assorted junk. I do web development work and being able to have a single laptop that can triple boot (OS X, Linux, Windows) is fantastic.
+	macbook pro is the best computer to ever be made. great product and will never buy an other brand again.
-	Good computer but for one fundamental flaw: the VOIP experience is DISMAL. The microphone could not be any worse. I consistently get horrible rain in the background and strange noises coming in and out. Furthermore the T420s dims the sound of the keys when typing, instead of eliminating it like the T410s did. End result: the listener can hear you when you type, just like it happens on any cheap computer.Lenovo, what have you done? You have upgraded the T410s and made it as good as a regular laptop.I also experience pretty serious keyboard flex on the left side, and it should be mentioned that the new 16:9 format (supposed to be an upgrade from the 16:10 the T410s had) is a true pain.IF YOU HAVE A T410S DO NOT UPGRADEI rate it with one star because I hate having upgraded to this piece of garbage.Note: I am Windows computer savvy.
+	despite the fact that the battery is 5126 mAh in it keeps it very small, there is no backlight, and the screen is dull and so comfortable, small laptop for web surfing
-	Many of the problems described in the negative reviews of this computer ring true for my machine as well: hinge problems, depressed left mouse key, poor screen, etc.  These problems occurred within a year of my buying the computer.  I've also had to contend with loose screws, keyboard letters popping off, scratched and damaged surfaces (due to the lack of a latch or anything else that allows the computer to remain securely closed) and two dead batteries.
+	So far, I'm loving it. I have only had it for a few days now and I have no complaints. Windows 8.1 is a learning curve and the two-finger scrolling takes a minute to get the hang of but so far so good!
+	I am comparing setup and use with my Dell Inspiron; I downloaded the drivers for my HP 6500 wireless printer to both.  Dell connected wirelessly right away; Even connecting via USB, Toshiba can't recognize the printer. I have removed 8 or 10 'opportunities' to purchase unwanted services, memberships, etc.  The Toshiba store will not go away.Good thing I don't need a really terrific laptop; oh, yeah! I still have the Dell!
+	I was highly pleased with both this seller and the product, and highly reccomend them to anyone looking to buy a used or refurbished laptop. I decided to go with refurbished since that meant it had been re built prior to me purchasing it and not directly from another user. Tampa Laptops had added a better wireless card, and expanded hard drive of 60 GB, and after looking at some new laptops in a store the other day for just under 500 bucks for 8 GB HD, i felt very fortunate mine was 60GB for 230 dollars. It has functioned fantastically other than the battery, which was the only thing in the description they couldnt garuantee and from what I hear is a common problem with the dell lattitude laptops anyways, tho it doesnt hold a charge very long it still does work, and Ive been using it for several months now, so still havent replaced the battery since I rarely use it for long without it being plugged in anyways. Its very snappy, with the decent wifi we have in the home anyways, and honestly ive seen newer lap and desk tops that run much slower HAHAHA. All in all i very highly reccomend this seller and this product i think anyone would be very pleased if their laptop works as nicely as mine does, im even thinkin of getting my parents and little brother one from Tampa Laptops since they are so nicely priced and high quality, and neither of them have a pc.
-	Experienced a major defect in the screen display a few months after the purchase of the computer and computer was and still is under warranty.  Contacted Dell Warranty support (based in India) and sent them a picture of the display screen.  They stated that the problem was not a defect because defects occur within a day of use.  They refused to honor the warranty for which the computer was still covered by.  Tried to escalate but the last individual (name of Jabat Singh) refused to contact their superior and said that he would only give me the number for their out of warranty department. I have purchased a total of 5 Dell computers in the past 10 years and previous to this purchase had good experience with their customer support.  Obviously this is no longer the case and I will never purchase another Dell computer again.  For anyone looking to purchase a computer, I would definitely steer clear of the Dell brand.
-	I got this for 399. Amazon has no taxes and this was free shipping... You won't be able to get something like this on any website or any place... dual core, 4gb ram and close to 300 gb of hardrive. At least for now.. I think i got very lucky when it was being sold for only 399. Amazon.. you guys should do this more often and people will be buying a lot!  rated 5 star and this was when i got it.8/21/2012i had this for about a year.. wow.. after coming back here and seeing all these reviews..  it seems like i wasn't the only one who was a victim to dell.. f** you dell.. i'm never buying yoru shitty product again. For me, the same thing happened too. 7 beeping shit and won't start. I had square trade so i sent it to them. guess what.. it was a software issue and square trade doesn't cover software issues.. damn.. what a perfect set up heh? they give you a 1 year manufacturer warranty so they made the computer only last about a year and let them break.. omg seriouslly.. do NOT get dells ever again...
+	Apple cada dia mejor y windows mas lejos de ios! realmente una laptop con todo lo que uno busca. EXCELENTE!
-	I just got the laptop, I am just setting it up and the screen and the whole computer turned off just by typing on the keyboard my info whereas I was registering.  This is something that I have never experienced with any other computer, and I am very unsatisfied.  You should not be selling a product that does not do what it is advertised for.
-	I have owned nothing but Toshiba laptops since my first purchase in 1989, and normally use them for five or six years before purchasing a new one.  They've always been trouble-free until I bought this one.  I should have known better--it was such a good price at Office Depot I fell for it.  Within weeks, when I was living in a foreign country, the computer started crashing.  Tech support gave me some lame things to try; I'm convinced the staff have no technical expertise and simply read what's written on the screen when they input the symptoms.  Four months after purchase, the HD died completely.  I was lucky to get warranty service in the foreign country, but the OS was in that language, which made it very difficult to get the computer functioning to my likes.  Once back in the U.S., I had a new HD installed but the warranty was finished by then.  Now, less than a year and a half later, the battery does not always charge, and it discharges very quickly even under mild use.I'll be buying another Toshiba when I get back home this summer, and hope that this one I have now was a lemon and not illustrative of the whole line these days.
-	Had this for 2 months.  Made the purchase because of the advertised features and because of Windows 8.  Wish I had gone with a Mac.  This POS has more glitches than a PC at the public library located nextdoor to the sex-offender halfway house.  What's worse, is like most things these days, you probably won't realize you have problem until after it is too late to make a return.  My machine had the audacity to go haywire between days 31 and 60.  The nerve!Also, don't waste your money on the warranty offered through Amazon.  It will likely not cover the things likely to go wrong but fear not....if you damage the internal johnson rod or rotator splint during a hailstorm in July between the hours of 5 and 6 a.m., you should be good to go.
-	I have been misleading by the photos because saw one picture with DVD burner. I am a small business owner I bought three of them and now I am so disappointed.I think that amazon's customer service should remove the photo of this laptop with the DVD Burner in it.I have been buying from Amazon for years and for the first time I am so disappointed
+	The reviews here are for the MD313LL/A, yet the computer is actually MD314LL/A, which has a faster processor and bigger hard drive.The MD314LL/A features a 2.8 GHz i7 processor, integrated Intel 3000 graphics and a 750 GB hard drive.  I've never owned an Apple laptop before, so there was a little bit of a learning curve.  Now that I'm getting the hang of it, I'm beginning to like OSX Lion better than Windows.  Programs can be run on separate virtual desktops, and the computer never misses a beat when several programs are active.  Switching between different desktops or open programs can be done by merely sliding three fingers forward on the large touchpad.  Control-clicking on words or phrases in Safari brings up a context sensitive menu which allows the user to select to view a dictionary, Wikipedia, or do a Google search in a pop-up window in the browser. You can also ask the computer to speak the word or phrase, if you have any doubts about pronunciation.  Safari also includes links to a library of plug-ins at extensions.apple.com, which includes a plug-in for Flash, so you can now watch free Hulu videos and other videos online.  The network preferences window makes it far easier than Windows to set up a list of public DNS servers to bypass the sometimes slow, glitchy ISP servers.This computer is completely silent. I wasn't even sure it had a cooling fan until I downloaded a utility to monitor the fan speed.  This computer is super fast, and the base plate never gets more than lukewarm.  The light weight, small footprint, lighted keyboard, crisp screen and speed really make this computer shine.The attention to detail is really outstanding.  The cooling vents on the back of the base are completely covered by a sliding plate when the lid is closed, keeping dust out of the innards. The power supply has flip out legs for winding the cord for storage and the prongs can be removed so it can be used as a brick type supply with the supplied AC cord. The computer also has a green LED battery status gauge built into the left side of the base, which is activated by a flush button.  The lid snaps shut quietly even though there are no cheesy stick-on rubber bumpers, and it is held closed by magnets. The built in light sensor shuts off the keyboard backlighting and brightens the display in bright ambient light. The computer also has a 3 axis accelerometer to protect the hard drive from damage. The attention to detail is why Macs are more expensive than the various PC clones.
+	Amazon fulfilled my expectations with regards to shipping and packaging, and I believe dell fulfilled the great quality in  my latitude.  I would definately recomend this for anyone looking for a cheaper alternative to the best quaility in the market.
-	I almost gave this machine two stars cause I felt bad for it ..... but nahh.  I just bought this machine today.  the first problem I noticed was that it seemed to be choking hard on the internet.  also there were several times with in the initial hour that windows 8 would freeze up I assume to the weak processor.  lastly (the straw that broke the camels back)  the headphone jack doesn't work.  and one search for the issue online will immediately inform you that it is not an uncommon issue.  Toshiba's website suggested that I use Windows update to ensure that I had the proper drivers updated and installed.  However the brand new lap top could not handle windows update.....  my suggestion is to just wait another paycheck and buy something in the 500 dollar range and skip this poor machine.
-	DO NOT PURCHASE THIS COMPUTER(Unless you want to waste your money and pay more to Asus for their mistakes)-- ASUS G75VW SHUT DOWN PROBLEMS--This is to anyone out there having random shut down problems with their Asus G75VW, I propose this, after my experiences and upon reading forum loads of your's...Please contact the NY State Attorney General's Office online and file a consumer complaint form if you purchased this laptop and it has since started randomly shutting off on you, like it has with some many of, after owning it from anywhere from 3 months to only a year and a half after paying $1500 for it.After calling them about 8-9 times regarding this issue, the final verdict is that they want us to pay for their mistake in manufacturing this faulty computer. They want US to pay for their error, sending it in, paying for shipping, paying for repairs, and moreover, ignoring their mistake and making no effort to remedy it. The problem is evident. Just simply Google search "Asus G75VW shutting down" (Asus, I suggest you do this to educate yourself as well, or to attempt to instill some feeling of guilt in you). You will see multiple forums with people with this problem for their supposed best gaming notebook.  Many people have attempted to fix things, but seeing as Asus is ignoring this, they haven't released any statements as to the exact issue, and therefore, no remedy other than making more money off of us by sending it to them for "Repairs".So, I propose we start filing complaints to our state attorney generals consumer departments. The more complaints we get the more likely the state attorney general will act on our behalf in regard to this problem.I am in NY state, so I especially encourage anyone living here to file something so we can hopefully get some action taken against this supposed great company.Their customer service representatives are close to useless, telling me to purchase recovery discs after I said I have reformatted. Giving me instructions for the wrong OS, and so on.So, let's try and do something. Please contact your own attorney general so we can all try to get a cost free solution to this problem, one that isnt at OUR expense to THEIR errors. Please include your attempts at contact them and your own remedies.For those in NY, please go here![...]Asus also said to go here for complaints to them, though I doubt, given their record, they will do anything.[...]Good luck all. :)
+	This laptop is great. I use this mainly for Internet and doing schoolwork. I am a college student and need it for Microsoft office and research. I have played some games on here and they work well, although I havent recently due to lack of free time. My only problem is that it didnt come with the whole 2010 Microsoft office. It comes with Microsoft word and Excell starter. And windows 7 is nice. I have it customized to my needs and things are just how/where I like them.
+	everything was perfect, I love this computer, have no problem. I bought the computer from Venezuela and I love it
+	After having been a user of Windows based computers for the past 21 years, I felt it was time for a change.  My last computer was a Compaq Presario that I bought in '07, and after a little over four years, its on it last legs.  I bought it with Vista installed on it and was sick and tired of the irritating crashes, screen freezes, time intensive updates, etc.  Additionally, it reached the point a couple of months ago where, I started getting messages saying an application failed, and shortly after that, the screen would flicker, and the entire taskbar along the bottom of the screen would just disappear.  About 15-20 minutes later, it would flicker and reappear.  If I was downloading anything when it flickered, I would lose it and have to start all over while dealing with the screen continously freezing.  So yesterday I went to the Apple store and bought a Macbook Pro and the only thing I have to say after having had it for 24 hours, is what took me so long?  Its a breeze to setup, not to mention it boots up in like 10 seconds and is ready to go.  No more waiting two or three minutes for my computer to boot up, followed by another minute or so for my home screen to populate itself and finally be ready for use.  I really like the Facetime camera and all of the effects you can create in it using iPhoto.  I'm still getting acclimated to Mac OS X Lion but thats not a problem.  To anyone considering making switch, I say go for it...you won't regret it.UPDATE:  3/1/11 Just attempted to create my first DVD using iMovie and I had planned to use iDVD but found that newer model MAcbook Pros are no longer being shipped with iDVD as a part of the iLife suite.  After speaking with Apple, I found that iDVD was discontinued because you can now create DVDs using the Finder menu.  This is a great product.
+	I recently made the PC - Mac switch, as my PC became more and more useless in my college career as a Music Education major. I've only had this computer for a couple of weeks, but I already love it! It works very well for exactly what I need it to, and has a much better battery life than my PC did despite having a similar amount of power. I would recommend this computer to anyone looking to purchase a new machine!
-	This computer sucks! For the price I can't believe how bad it sucks! My Acer was 100 times better. Its as slow as dial up through AOL 20 years ago. It freezes all the time. Doesn't matter if I'm on the internet or working in office.  I can't stand it and because its been over 30 days there's nothing I can do about it.I'll never buy this brand again. I'm so completely unhappy with it.
-	If you do not live in USA and bought this notebook during your trip, be careful! I bought this ultrabook 2 months ago and now I am having problem with charger bad function, I need to put some stuff between chager plug and notebook. Asus International Warranty does not work in my country (Brazil) actually, It`s not available in South America. I have contacted ASUS for RMA and I need to pay the shipping to get it there (Milpitas, CA ) and the worst part, when it returns I could pay lot of customs tax. I am not sure what is worst, my country customs or Asus who made this weak ultrabook.UPDATE 10/02Issues problems is just getting bigger. Now it's a HD problem.I was using Windows and then this crap frozen and there is no HD on boot option, It was showing only the CMOS screen.
-	I bought this to use like a tablet with a keyboard (for writing and editing) and quickly noticed that some punctuation keys are laid out differently than a normal keyboard.  It was kind of a pain to get around that, and slowed my typing considerably.  Strike one.  I then noticed that it was often slow to respond, and sometimes (more often than it should have) shut down on a whim.  Strike two.  I then had it plugged in to charge, and heard this fizz-pop sound, and a slight burnt plastic smell.  It overheated, and apparently fried the thing.  It hasn't worked since (screen will light up when turned on, but will not go to any welcome screen and then shuts off).  Strike three.  Game over.Do not purchase this.  It is not worth a dime, much less the price they're charging.  This is an example of an off-brand that just doesn't measure up.
-	The item was not performing normally, I contacted Sony support, we followed some steps and at the end they said there is a problem with the memory and the hard disk is not performing well. I returned the item to amazon. They are understandable, helpful and fast responders. That what make me continue dealing with them.I think this is an individual situation because Amazon and Sony are huge names in the business.
+	Good performance for the specs. Screen visibility is not good for the slightest angle movement. Feels tough but heavy. Overall, good for a discounted price.
-	My screen is giving out everyday, i hear sounds but the picture comes in and out, the touch screen doesnt always touch and when it does it clicks on the wrong things ! i tried calling gateway and i cant reach customer service I HATE THIS LAPTOP i will never purchase something from Gateway AGAIN
+	This Notebook is super fast with its Pentium Dual-Core Processor running at 1.73ghz. It also has a superfast integrated graphics card with 8-256mb dynamic memory and enough speed to run most games.The internal wireless card quickly connects to the network and is very fast.I'm really glad I bought this notebook computer.
+	First of all, I am a systems engineer doing systems development for the past 15 years or more. I have used the very first versions of windows until windows 7. I have used all kinds of other operating systems like Android, Linux, Unix, Ubuntu etc etc.This is my first Mac and I am very impressed with my 2 days of of usage so far. Getting used to trackpad and gestures took a while but I think I am comfortable now.I upgraded RAM to 8GB (bought Crucial sticks from Amazon). Removing back cover needs some mastery of tools but when I removed the factory RAM and installed new sticks, they were recognized instantly and the macbook became even faster. If you are a normal email/simple app user, there is absolutely no need to upgrade memory. 4GB of memory is more than enough for this OS.I could configure VPN in minutes (compared to hours on a windows PC) and it works right out of the box. There is no unnecessary software that came with this Mac and no need to uninstall anything. No virus issues as well. Everything simply works. No crashes or freezes so far.I am an avid Google chrome user but when I saw how fast the Safari browser is, I didn't even think of installing Chrome on this.When the screen backlight is set to 50%, battery lasts for about 7.5 hrs with light usage. Video/Youtube etc strains the battery a bit more.Hardware is a work of art and there are no complaints about it. Looks and feels beautiful and very sturdy.I expect to use this notebook for at least 5 years if not more.If you are also a windows user and thinking of moving to Mac, just don't think. Do the plunge and you won't repent. I gaurantee it.Thanks,Sam.
+	I have been using Macbook Pro for the past 2 years (though it was an official one). When I used to compare it with my personal windows laptop, actually I could not compare...there was nothing to compare. Macbook was light years ahead of it. Another plus was that with Mac OSX, you can surf the web without worrying the intrusion of spywares and viruses in your machine, effectively eliminating the need for an anti virus. All these factors were compelling enough for me to shell out 1700$ to make it mine.I have now upgraded to LION OS and oh boyyy...using it is like biting through a cheesecake...smooth! I also do a lot of photography and developing pics is just an out of the world experience on Mac. The screen is so vibrant that the pics almost speak out. I have a glossy screen and since I mostly use it indoors, I got no issues. In fact I love it more than the anti-glare one.Coming to the performance, well this is supposed to the most advanced laptop in the market and it truly lives up to its name. The booting (after installing LION) is around 30-40 seconds! The clicks are so responsive that I have forgotten what latency is, the speakers are a nice addition and it even has a slot for SDHC cards...I can just takes pics and insert the memory card directly into this slot and boom...its done. Goodbye USB cables, now I don't need to depend on you. Lastly the batter life is amazing, it gives me around 6 hrs on normal work and around 5-5.5 hours with wi-fi on.All in all, thumbs up for Macbook Pro and also to Amazon for letting me have a 100$ waiver.
-	Note that there are no buttons for the mouse pad.  You have to tap the pad for left click, and tap with two fingers for right click.  Well, that's ok till you try to right click drag.  This is not possible.  Also after a few updates, the two finger right click will probably stop working.Next, if you create a restore media on USB, and try to use it to restore, you won't be able to activate your windows.  Not to mention that you need a very specific type of USB stick, and good luck trying to figure this out.  Win 8 machines do not include an install code.  So if you have trouble activating windows, hp won't help except to say that you have to restore from CD.  I haven't tried this yet.  MS will say that you need an install code.  They will sell you one for $40.00.  It probably won't work, and you will have to get a different media set.
+	I am really satified with the PC. MacPro 13.3 is fast, very portable, runs smoothly. It has neither frozen nor crashed for a seconds since it was purchased more than a month ago.
-	I don't like to write bad reviews, but this time i feel like i need to. I bought this computer as a birthday gift to my child - i'm a single mom with just one income so i couldn't afford to buy a new one. I searched and searched, until i found this seller with marvelous reviews. I decided to go with them and buy this used computer. Well, the charged melted after 1 week and the DVD drive didn't read the CDs. I contacted the seller, and explained what happened. They asked me to send pictures of the melted charger and explain in more detail what happened with the Cd drive. I did what i was asked - pictures and a detailed explanation. Surprising to me - I have gotten NO RESPONSE after the first one. I even bought the refurbished one, thinking that it will be in a better shape. I'm sorry to say this - but THIS SUCKS.
+	WARNING: THIS COMPUTER WILL NOT RUN SMOOTHLY AND WILL CONSTANTLY OVERHEAT AND SHUTDOWN UNLESS YOU TAKE THE FOLLOWING STEPS:1: Go to [...] and download the drivers for this laptop.2: Go into power settings and scale the CPU Power to 75%. Note that you will have to do this for all the power modes, plus you'll have to either plug or unplug your power cable and do it again.3: Purchase a cooling pad. I recommend the Cooler Master U2 which can be purchased here on Amazon at: Cooler Master NotePal Configurable R9 NBC 8PCKA GPNow you should be good to go. I've had these steps implemented and have had no problems with my PC. But now that's settled, let's get on with the review!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I've had this laptop for a couple months now, so I feel comfortable in doing a review on it. I actually got this laptop as a replacement for an Acer M5 ultrabook that kept crapping out on me, so I was pretty skeptical on how this one would perform. In short, this laptop is a very fast, well built machine.A10 processor: The CPU in this laptop is very fast, and contains some on-board graphics. It has a windows index score of 6.9, and can handle games at least at native resolutions. However, because this is an AMD core, it generates more heat, and it is less efficient than Intel equivalents. And while it can play games, it only will for about 10 minutes before overheating, so getting a cooling pad for gaming is a must. On day-to-day tasks, it is fine.Keyboard and track-pad: they keyboard works fine, no problems there. It is back-lit, and has full sized keys with a number pad. However, when the laptop gets hot, the keyboard flex can become almost unacceptable. I also like how the function keys are enabled by default, where you don't have to hold down "fn" to do things like change the brightness. The track pad is an average-sized, finely textured piece of plastic with 2 separate, responsive buttons. Windows gestures work as well as you would hope.Body: The lid and body are made of a finger print magnet aluminum, while the hinge and screen bezel are made of a hideous reflective, podruding black plastic. The hinges creaks uncomfortably, but other then that, it is very solid.Extras: Beats audio is pointless in my opinion, but it sounds above-average. The included equalizer software is a nice touch, though. The webcam and microphone suck, and are in poor quality. The screen is very nice and has accurate color reproduction, but has poor viewing angles. One more thing: the bluetooth in my laptop seems to be broken as I couldn't get a wireless keyboard to connect to it.So overall, this is a very good deal for $600. It is a capable gaming machine, and a good looking one for that. While the build quality is hit or miss, I doubt there is a better overall notebook out there better than this one.
+	Yes. Just yes. The laptop is amazing! I only wish that they all had built in 3D. Only the DS73-3D has built in 3D. For those who are confused, the other models have 3Dtv play which just means that you can play in 3D on your 3D tv through an HDMI and the laptop has a built in ir-emitter so you just need the find the glasses. But no, this one doesn't do 3D on the laptop itself. Other than that IT IS AWESOME!
-	I was so excited and happy with my macbook pro 13 at the beginning. Loved the graphics, layout, easy use... everything.I bought mine in October 2011, so 6 months ago from now.Unfortunately after only 3 months of use it started to go to hell. My macbook now constantly drops the wi-fi connection - I have to turn it on and off about every 5 minutes to be able to even load pages. I know that it has nothing to do with the router or wi-fi connection itself because I live in a house sharing the internet with 6 other people - it works perfectly for them, and 3 of them own macbooks or imacs themselves. Regardless of whether they're home or not, for me the problem still persists.I am not alone on this, if you search for it you find that tons of people have this same problem - and there is still no fix for it. Even after having gone via applecare they havent gotten anywhere.I feel so disappointed and tricked that I decided to go for a macbook!
-	After 34 days the "I" key quit working, I contacted the seller, after several days he responded and recommended a web site that might offer a fix. But when I tried to turn the computer on nothing happened, it would not turn on. I contacted the  seller again explaining what happened. He told me there was nothing he could do as it was past the 30 day return policy (He said he was abiding by Amazon's policy) Also said he'd never had any trouble before so there must be" post delivery damage"to cause the computer to quit working. I ask the seller if he could fix it or I could return it but he would not work with me.  Amazon will not back you up either as a buyer. I filed a complaint with them and they said it was past the 30 days.  There was not any misuse or damage done to the computer. I had a computer business tech diagnose the problem and he said the motherboard was fried. So now I'm paying $50. a month for a piece of junk. Stay away from this seller!!!!
+	Bought it July 2011 and still on love with it. got 1 issue during the early adoption of OS-Lion but Apple Care were able to rebuild it the machine for me, after that it went so smoothly.Few items from heavily user:- Battery will need to be flushed every month for better performance.- The machine from time to time get warm due to a third party software that was eating the CPU cycles.- Recommend to get external disk and take frequent backup using the Time machine.My next laptop will be new Macbook for sure.
+	I just received the laptop today and have not been able to shut it off!! I researched a lot of different computers, I wanted something for everyday, I don't use it for work just personal stuff.Right out of the box was ready to go, awesome is all I can say! I can't even hear it run. I noticed in the reviews different people complained about fan noise, I have not even heard the fan.Switching from windows to mac is a huge change, but you catch on real quick.1st day, not a lot of time on it yet but it's awesome!I wouldn't hesitate ordering this computer, you won't be sorry, and fast, unbelievably fast!!Love it!
+	Like the title says, I'm a PC, but there are just somethings I couldn't handle work wise when it came down to it. First and foremost, I would still be with my amazing HP if windows 8 didn't RUIN the whole idea of an operating system. Secondly, all my work is done on a mac, so it's frustrating syncing back and forth between the two.However, I guess what they say about apples are true. Once you go mac, you never go back.
-	These things will not hold up to even the mildest abuse.  My kid's school issued these cromebooks to all their students.  My Daughter broke hers display by placing it in her backpack with books.  My sons codebook the cover on the back is coming lose.  He has no idea why.  From what the school tells me they are having lots of problems with these pieces of junk.  Especially with the displays.
+	After being a PC user for over 30 years, I decided to join the Mac family. I am very impressed so far. It is very user friendly and much faster. I am glad to have made this purchase.
-	I rate my item 0 a big 0 I have never used it, it was shipped to me very dirty and it was not like how it was looking on the add, it was sent to me with a broken battery, the screen was really really dirty that there was candy sticking on the screen and it was sticky. I have wrote to the guy that sold it to me and he didnt have the nerve to write me back. I hope that the amazon corporate office see this scam and take consideration.I am NOT HAPPY!!!
+	The first computer I have purchase which runs on a Mac platform. I will still continue to use my Windows computers as I believe they are more geared towards the businessman, but the Macbook is something that I will use at home. I enjoy this machine. Very light, user friendly and crash-free.
-	First: This is a review of an older model of this same product which is discontinued:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041RRS0I/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00However, I find that I must warn any potential buyers about the dangers of buying this series of notebooks, and also any other product by ASUS.I bought the notebook on 22 September 2010On 2nd November the gaming mouse that came with it stopped working.I called support. They said mouse is not covered under warranty. Ok, so I said forget it.On 3rd December the BD-ROM drive stopped working. I called support.I was shocked to learn that no service personnel would be sent to my house, and I would have to visit an 'authorised' service center. They provided me with service center numbers. I called them. No one answered on the nearest one for 2 days and another service center put me on hold for 20 mins and then hung up.So I said, forget it. I don't use my BD-ROM anyway.Then a few days later the sound would jitter while playing videos, which again support didn't really help me with. I looked online and upgraded my Nvidia graphics drivers and somehow that fixed the sound. Weird.Then the random freezes and shutdowns started. I cannot count the number of times the computer would just go to the BSOD (blue screen of death) and shutdown. On restart sometimes it would again freeze on the login screen, and I would have to restart it multiple times hoping it will switch on properly on next reboot.Around the same time, the battery life went bust. It would hardly run for 15 mins on battery and just die.But this wasn't that much of a problem because I use a MacBook Air when I go for meetings etc. This just stays at home, and so is constantly plugged in.Finally around a little over a year into the computer's life, I decided to backup my data and reset my computer by reinstalling windows, which wasn't exactly a smooth process either. I had no help and had to constantly refer to online tutorials and figure out what to do to even begin the reinstall process. After this, the computer functioned smoothly for around 8 months. What great 8 months those were.But a couple of days back, in the middle of some work, my computer just turned off. Slowly, as if it were dying. No BSOD, no freeze, just died. I haven't been able to switch it on since then. I have called support 3 times, each time my details were taken and before anything else, the line would be hung up. I am now tired of waiting for 10 mins before someone answers and another 5 to provide my details and then being hung up on.The product worked really well when it did for those 8 months. The performance is mind blowing. The power to play games and run multiple graphics intensive applications at the same time is fantastic. But it got in my way so much and so many parts didn't function correctly that I can only remember the bad times.I am considering donating it to a geek friend of mine for salvage. Maybe he can use it as some form of computer crash test dummy.
-	I bought my Zenbook Prime UX31A over 3 months ago.When I received it, I noticed that a few keys don't work (up/down/esc which I actually use as a software developer).I contacted Asus, tried updating the BIOS, and eventually decided to open an RMA.The notebook was purchased in the US, but since I travel for business all the time and been to the Netherlands at the time, I sent it to the Dutch repair center.I was told that the repair usually takes 7-10 business days.After 14 work days, I contacted them, and they said that since the notebook was not from the Netherlands, they had to order parts and I will have to wait another month (!!!).I told them that I won't be in the Netherlands by then and asked them to ship it back, unfixed, so I can send it to a different service center (Japan).They failed to send the notebook back on time even though they had 2 weeks to do so and I called every single day, sometimes 2-3 times a day!They even had the nerve to tell me that they will not ship it anywhere outside the Netherlands, even though I do not reside there...Moreover, since they did end up sending the notebook back *after* I flew to Japan, they made a mistake and wrote me an email saying I did receive the notebook and it was signed by a woman named "Linda" (I don't know any Linda! I thought my computer was lost!!!).After a lot of stress and a few days (!!!) of angry e-mails they notified me that "Linda" was actually one of their colleagues...Long story short, 3 months later, my notebook is still in the Netherlands, and still was not fixed (!!!!!).They recently offered to buy the notebook back ("buyback"), but, to my surprise, even that is turning out to be an issue since I don't reside in the Netherlands and my bank account is not in that country...I was also in touch with Mr. Tien Phan who, while being very nice, could not help me at all...He explained that while they do offer a global warranty (which is a useless joke, mind you!), he cannot contact the Dutch repair center, as they are simply contractors, and he added a bunch of other excuses which, as a customer who needs his notebook back, I honestly don't care about.Simply put, I had the notebook for a few days, could not use it, Asus failed to fix it and failed to keep me informed about how long it would take to fix it.I paid a lot of money for it which they're refusing to return.Over 3 months later, I don't have the notebook, not the money, and no idea when or if I'll get either of them back.Asus produces low-quality products, refuse to replace their faulty hardware, fail to repair it, their global warranty is useless, they directly made me lose a lot of time and money and caused me a lot of frustration.I am writing this so other people think twice before they purchase an Asus, and hopefully will choose a more reliable brand.Doing research online, I see I'm not the only person affected, and it seems like every single person gets the same kind of treatment from Asus...Do yourself a favor, choose a different brand!!!
+	I got this in a bundle at best buy with what looks like a 7-8 in tablet for 899 or something like that. I get home and start playin with it you know....downloading everything and checking browsing speeds.  First of all I was blown away with the ease of use of incorporating a touchscreen laptop. Within a couple minutes I was blazing through Amazon with this crazy swipe of the page thing that made it so much easier to surf. YEAH exactly what I wanted....Don't let those guy fool you i5 is plenty to surf a super high speeds with 8+ sites open classes, and Microsoft word (hint i'm a student).Now to the tablet. Super Cool!  It also worked cohesively as the laptop it was even easy to type on the little virtual screen. (BYW the keys on the laptop are AMAZING).  OK ok the tablet also had all the cool swipe surfing like the laptop and was a quad core as well...I think everything was 4th gen too.  Of course the insurance and protection on both products is where they get ya at an extra 300 bucks  for drops and spills...being s chef I have this problem a lot.  First  time buyer of Toshiba. Lol "Limits Pushed!"Donnie
+	UPDATE: The first MacBook Pro they sent was apparently a lemon. I took it to my school's tech department and they couldn't find anything that tested bad but they said the computer just wasn't working right and was running way too slow. Plus there was an intermittent issue with the battery not showing a charge. They encouraged me to ask Amazon for an exchange. Amazon agreed to send me an exchange for free and even refunded my Office download that got wasted. Anyways, the second MacBook Pro they sent me is working much better and so far hasn't bogged down like the last one would do all the time.I would have happily given Mac 5/5 except it is just so slow even after all the updates finished installing compared to my Windows 7 machine with less powerful hardware. There are many design elements of the MacBook Pro I like from the laptop itself to the software. But once again, it's just so slow compared to Windows 7 (at least in my experience, I am expecting this review to get flamed by hardcore Mac users regardless). It seems like I spend a third of my time looking at that little colored pinwheel, which seems especially bad since I have the i7 processor. Honestly, if the Mac was faster, I would probably use it more than my Windows 7 machine. I'm going to try upgrading it from 4GB to 8GB RAM soon to see if that helps. I want to like the Mac so bad, but when my Windows 7 computer does most activities literally 2-3 times faster... Anyways, PLEASE don't leave me comments about how fast your Mac is unless you have tips on how to speed mine up. I am just stating MY experience and not the experience others might have with Mac.
-	I love gadgets and technology in general. I own several netbooks, some of which I have purchased through Amazon.com.That being said, if you wish to make a fashion statement, buys one of these. They look great!  The performance on the other hand is sub par at best.The start up time is painfully slow.The interface for conectabilty is cumbersome, slow, and rigid.Worst of all. . . the text is nearly unreadable. I have great eyesight. But, I need binoculars to read the text on this thing.Conclusion: If you want to impress someone, show them this piece of eye candy. But, don't turn it on. They will laugh at you!!!!!!!!!!
-	This has been by far the worst computer experience I have ever had. I will absolutely never buy from Toshiba again. I ordered from Toshiba directly. In order of occurrence:1) They said they'd ship next day, they shipped almost three weeks later...and only after I sent an inquiry.2)Computer finally arrives. It was fine, speedy and light as promised. Fan is a bit loud, speakers are tinny but I expected this from the reviews.3) 2.5 months in: my screen stops working.4) I troubleshoot with their online whatsit, repairs are suggested.5) I call, go through troubleshooting again. Tech services interrupts constantly while I am answering to ask the exact same question again. Eventually, they decide I do in fact need repairs. Tells me I need to pay for shipping...on my two month old computer, under warranty, with a major issue. I have had three computers, with three brands, I have never been asked to pay shipping on a warrantied computer. When I object, tech services interrupts again to tell me how its so awesome that they include all the packaging and everything...this is really not that awesome, its just basic customer service. I ask to return and after trying to sell the shipping about 4 more times he finally transfers me to customer service.6) Upon arriving at customer service there is NO option to speak to a representative, pressing zero saying representative gets me HUNG UP ON by the electronic system. Wow.7) Somehow finally manage to speak to a person, and a manager. I'm informed that I can't return my computer b/c its past 14 days BUT the shipping actually is free, they can set up a box to be sent. Greeat, we can finally get this fixed up.8) Box arrives...and its 2 inches too small for my computer. Seriously?9) Can't find anyway at all in their completely automated website to ask the fairly simple question of "can you resend my box, in the right size, please?" When I finally get someone on live chat, all they do is give me the number for customer service...the customer service system that hangs up on its customers.Any one or two of these things wouldn't be so bad. They're just part and parcel of the digital age of customer service but EVERY single step with Toshiba has been an uphill battle through crappy service, crappy systems, and crappy policies that treat the customer as an enemy. The computer is light, and when it worked it was nice to have, but in the end, its just NOT worth dealing with Toshiba.
+	So, I love my MacBook Pro.  I didn't buy mine off of Amazon, but got it custom from Mac--so it's a slightly different setup.  I went with the high speed hard drive, which is only 500 GB.  I had a Mac Powerbook way back in the early 90s that zoomed at 33 Mhz.  LOL  Things have improved.  Lots to like... nothing too surprising...some of the good things:1) Fast.2) Very intuitive platform like all macs.3) Looks great.4) Safer in terms of virus, etc.5) Offer 14 day return if bought in store (Apple Store) without a restocking fee, which is nice. (Ended up ordering two to compare screens, and returning one.)6) High Res--whites much brighter, grays better, colors better--which is to be expected.7)Trackback functionality is great.  Can zoom up and down and scroll very easily, flip pages, etc.8) Cheap to upgrade OS.  $35 or so vs. $200 for any Windows machine.Now some of the bad (minor criticisms, I realize):1)Don't offer OS back-up CDs anymore.  Very difficult as customer to create it on your own.2)DVD Drive doesn't have Blueray, and it's crap--HP.  Makes a ton of noise.  Can easily scratch DVDs if move computer while running.  (Had two different MacBook Pros--same issue with both.)3)Wonder about the safety of the Apple on the back of the screen.  If you touch it, you can actually see your finger on the screen.  Wonder if you'd be totally screwed if computer hit in some way.4) Pain that they don't have High Res w/ glossy in stores--so difficult to compare.  Had to order both to see which I liked--and then return another one.5) Battery on high res w/ high speed hard drive 7200 RPMs not great. Only have about 4 hours battery life.6) Choose not running in native resolution on High Res, end up in much lower than even the standard res.Just so you know, you can upgrade and do things yourself.  Don't believe that you can't open it yourself.  They show you how in the directions.  Memory, etc. totally overpriced through the Apple Store, but can do it yourself for 1/4 the price.  I also truly believe that one could probably put the MacOS on a Toshiba for like $600.00. ;)
+	My daughter is leaving for college.  From what I understand from talking to her, most universities have a large open pit in which they stone the students who arrive for their freshman year with PCs.  It's all about cool and image.  The price on Macs is incredibly steep, about three times what a really good laptop PC would cost.  While I have yet to see what that extra thousand bucks gets you, it did buy me freedom from at LEAST a year of griping and foul moods from my daughter.  Buy a Mac, be unique, just like everybody else.
-	After using my $1299 worth of birthday money saved up for years, I decided to purchase a Lenovo Yoga 11s. I am aware that this area is reserved for Yoga 13 reviews, but I must voice my opinion on my 11s and about Lenovo in general.The computer itself works great, I love my computer. It's a well put together machine. The only complaints about the machine that I have are that it is slow and laggy (which could be windows 8), and that the flip from tablet mode to notebook mode is not always smooth. These things are minor as this computer is superior to any other tablet pc.Now, the bad stuff: Lenovo as a company does not care for their customers. To those who do not care about the computer's company, disregard my one star review. The computer on its own is fantastic. But, if something goes wrong, Lenovo cannot fix it (event with purchased extended warranty). Here's why: I looked at my computer a few days ago and realized that screws were missing from the bottom. These screws can only be put into a Lenovo product via a machine and do not have room for a phillips head or a flat head. So...I called Lenovo and waited for 10 minutes on the phone. I was disconnected. I called back and talked to Katherine who barely spoke English and informed me that the only way for this computer to be fixed would be to send it out to Texas to have it fixed for a week. Well, I'm going to Europe in a week, how am I supposed to know if the laptop will get in on time?Note: I've been a huge supporter of Apple up until September 2013. I figured it was time to move to the PC world as I am a coder and designer for websites. When I used to call Apple, they would send a replacement PC or iPod or iPad free of charge as long as I shipped back my defective product on time and the product met their specifications.Lenovo doesn't accept this as a viable option. After talking to Katherine, she said the best they could do would be to send me screws. These screws cannot be put in by a human without specific tools. I waited on the line for 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes and finally I get in touch with a manager. She informs me of the same thing: I can only get the screws sent to me. There is no other option. There is no way to make me happy. I must conform to Lenovo's standards of fixing a customer's concern.Needless to say, I will be posting about Lenovo and their despicable customer service for all to know. I have not decided what I am going to do yet, I believe my next step will be to call Apple and see if I can grab a MacBook Air and trade in this PC using their Trade-In Program. If not, I suppose I'll have to deal with this $1299 mistake. For a college kid, that's quite a huge mistake.
-	I absolutely hate this computer and regret spending money on it. I strongly encourage either purchasing a top end laptop from somewhere that is not Dell. At the least, purchase a cheap laptop-you won't be able to tell the difference. The sound quality is about the only decent thing about this computer. Aside from that, it is slow, the battery is atrocious, the graphics card will not allow any updates for gaming purposes and the disk drive no longer works. Worse, every encounter I have had with the Dell customer service has been horrible. I have taken good care of this computer. I wish I could say it did the same for me.
-	I bought this laptop when it on sale from Amazon, the delivery is pretty fast, but when I got this laptop. I am more than disappointed, the box is opened and the laptop is a used one with big HEAT/FAN NOISE issues. I used the HD tune to check the disk status and found out its already charged and cycled for 19 times and 47 hours. It is unaccepted and a shame. So I returned it in the 2nd day without hesitate.Anyone who is willing to buy this ultra book, plz be aware of these problems. Hopefully you can get a full refund for it.
+	Excelent.No Problems at all.100% recommended.Apple makes very good products, so I love this machine, its fast, nice operating system.
-	Your PC's are junk.  18months life on a laptop is a joke. The Pavillion had nothing but issues from the day I purchased it.  I had to send it in within 2 months of buying it.  Took a month to get it returned.  It always felt way to hot and I was worried that it could actually start a fire .  We are a family with five PC's in our home.  My husband also is the tech at a major corporation.  This is ridiculous.  I would recommend that you purchase another brand of PC from a company that stands behind there products.
-	I would love to still be using this ultrabook but gave up when I received number 4 and it still didn't perform as needed, so I am writing this review from a MacBook Air... which is close in price but a Mac....not anywhere as nice looking... not as fast to boot up.... but the keyboard works..... issues I experienced  with the 4 were all keyboard issues... yes, it was restored, yes I reloaded drivers repeatedly, and no I did not have enough patience to type with two fingers as there was some thought that the issue was related to a fast keying speed. Problems were a keyboard that appeared to simply quit acknowledging keystrokes, but that could have been a mouse issue also, one of the zenbooks intermittently lost the "quote key", the "d" key, the "backspace" key and the space key.... along with all the keys at one time or another...yes, it reset but no reason nor rhyme as to how long it took...Great looking ... I  think the best features but didn't meet expectations .
+	10x easier to use than a pc laptop. Faster too. I will never go back to pc. I was one of those people that debated on a pc or mac for months. Im very happy with my decision to go with a macbook pro.
-	This was the SECOND UX31A-DB71 computer purchased from Amazon.  The first one had a serious problem - it crashed 9 times in the first 24 hours, and was returned.  Amazon of course was very understanding, and shipped the replacement (this one) before I had shipped the defective one back.  However, the new one - this one - turned out to be defective too, but it waited until I had upgraded to Win 8 Pro and had installed Office 2010 Pro. The function keys are supposed to control numerous computer functions when the Ctrl key is held, but none of these worked. I chatted with Asus Tech Support, and they immediately advised me to return it or send it to them for repair.  As my headline implies, I'm returning it for a refund and buying something else.  Asus apparently hasn't figured out this Ultrabook thing well enough to justify $1,500.
-	I ordered mine recently and I got it 2 days ago.. I was very excited but when I started to type for the first time more then 10 keys came off and there was a huge crack in the screen the 3rd time I turned it on.. never buy apple they suck.
-	Warranty is for 1 year. One month after the one year mark the damn thing crashed and the hard drive died. Called Sony customer service to see if they can help. They offered charging me $300 to fix it.How convenient it is to die right after warranty expires. I only use this laptop for web search and MS Office. Last time I will buy a Sony product!!! I've never had a laptop breakdown so quickly.
-	as a student who does a lot of typing, it is extremely frustrating to have paid $1000 for a computer with a keyboard that doesn't work as it should.
-	I am sad to report that after only 4 months my hard drive went out.  I have also had issues with the operating system which would not take the 8.1 upgrade, as well as the blue screen of death.  It has been out for repair under warranty once, and less than a week back home it needs to go back for repair again.  I have spent hours on the phone with Dell troubleshooting, running their tests, etc., as well as my own troubleshooting, and hours reloading my software twice now.  Now with it having to go back, I would have to reload my software again a third time.  I told Dell no.  I am fighting with them to buy this lemon back.  I do not have the time to waste hours of my time and go without my computer repeatedly. Additionally, I have lost faith in the longevity of this computer.  I honestly believe it will not last 2-3 years, perhaps not even a year.  My last Dell lasted over 6-7 years, without one problem!  I never spent hours troubleshooting in all those years.  In just the four months I have owned this lemon, I have spent lost hours and much stress tied to the phone.Dell has passed me around to various departments and managers, telling me they will not offer a refund or replacement. Just my warranty.  I will not tolerate this, as I purchased a new computer, and expect the quality and reliability of a new computer.  I did not get this.  I could have purchased a used laptop and saved hundreds of dollars and had less problems, perhaps no problems.  This computer is not even of refurbished quality, because a refurbished machine is operating without continuing problems.I have done extensive research and have found others complaining about Dell in the last year.  Many of which are like me, former Dell owners with previous reliable machines.  It is apparent that Dell's computers have declined in quality and workmanship.  And the customer service is built around defending the Company to save a dime, rather than owning up to a defective machine, and sending the customer a new replacement after multiple issues.  They would rather put out a customer of their computer repeatedly (1 to 2 weeks in repair), having them on the phone for up to 1 hour to 1.5 hours at a time or more, each and every time.  And each issue generally takes multiple phone calls.  And the customer service representatives are of foreign descent, and extremely difficult to understand, making the situation that much more frustrating.So if you are considering a Dell because you once had a quality Dell machine like myself and many others, do your research so you are not disappointed when you learn first hand it is not the same Company/quality as before.I personally will be taking this matter to small claims court, bringing Dell to my own county.  I will not allow myself sold an inferior product and then the manufacturer refusing to take responsibility and do the right thing.  My time is valuable, and if you value yours, do your research before considering Dell.  They simply are not the Company they used to be, and you will find many articles online of people with lemons like this discussing this very topic.
-	I also had a hard drive fry after 2 months..lost all data..how long will the replaced hardrive last? Stay away from HP!
-	I purchased two ultrabooks for work, the UX31E and the UX31A, out of the box, the UX31E had an issue with the speakers, but I figured I could live with it.  After 1 Year and 3 Weeks, the Screen died on the UX31E, and ASUS would not repair it under warranty.  So unless I fork out around $300, I have an expensive paperweight.The UX31A had display issues right out of the gate (dead pixels, lcd bleeding), and had to be sent back.  After it came back from repair, a new screen was put on and it was fine, but the HDMI port no longer worked, and since it was just after the 1 year warranty period, ASUS will not repair it without substantial charge.  They don't stand by their products and manufacturing quality of these ultrabook units is very poor.  If you want a laptop to work for 1 year, and are willing to have downtime from RMAing it, then feel free to purchase this unit.  If you want a stable, problem-free unit, purchase a Samsung or Apple or another manufacturer.
-	Save your money.  Don't buy this laptop.  It works well at first, but then begins locking up randomly.  As others have stated running any game even on minimum graphics causes it to overheat to the point of burning you when you touch it to turn it off, and it overheats QUICKLY!  Mine is on one of the industries leading cooling units, because Gateway convinced me that my problem was an inadequate cooling unit, not an inadequate CPU.  And if you're like me and beyond frustrated when you finally call customer service, only to get someone who's accent is so thick you honestly can not understand a word they say, then you may find problems with their tech support as well.  I had high hopes when I bought this laptop, but the only thing it has done was raise my blood pressure.
-	right out of the box the wireless card did not work. I called the company telling them it was bad, and they agreed to have the computer shipped back to them to fix. before i could get it back to them, it stopped working completely. I had to go out and buy a brand new macbook pro from the store to finish the project i was working on.
-	Right Speaker was presenting buzzing sounds after only months of purchase. 30 min later after presenting the buzzing sounds on the right speaker, it stopped functioning.
-	Bought this because the price, $549, was attractive at the time.  The hard drive failed within a year and a half.  The cooling fan now needs to be replaced.  Search the forums and you will learn the cooling fan really only lasts a few hundred hours.  The trackpad does not work because of the weak frame flexes in your lap and causes the trackpad to flex in such a way that it shorts itself out.I mostly build my systems, or buy Asus and Dell.  This is my first HP product and despite it's good looks, it really is cheap, cheap, cheap.  They cut corners every where they could.Battery life is around 02:45 new.
-	The computer stopped working a couple of weeks after I received it. I already sent a complaint to you and supposedly you are working on it.It is, according to a computer technician who checked it, a severe electrical problem, probably due to an accident. The computer has rough marks and a glued track on the bottom!!!I hope you would be able to take care of the problem. Thanks.Best wishes,Jose L. Martin, M. D.
+	I try this machine and feel comfortable with profession work. It's really good for student, staff. But the battery always around 3 ~ 4 hour. With some applications and games need a strong processor, 6GB DDR3 is not enough. I prefer Acer Aspire V5-571P-6698 than Acer Aspire V5-571P-6831 because of the larger memory. You will never use full performance of 1.8 Ghz core with 6GD DDR3. Trust me !Beside, Acer is the famous brand, I bought many acer laptop for my students and feel ok with Acer's machines.Acer Aspire V5-571P-6831 : $598.00- 1.8 GHz Core i5 3337U- 6 GB DDR3- Item Weight: 5.5 pounds- Top ### Not AvailableAcer Aspire V5-571P-6698 : $529.99- 1.5 GHz Core i3-2377M- 8 GB DDR3- Item Weight: 5.3 pounds- Top #29 in Best Seller notebook(Amazon)You can look Acer Aspire V5-571P-6698 with special discount here:B00CHGNCZ0
-	I cannot open 2 websites at 1 time.  It will not connect to the internet when I tried to activate my microsoft office 2010 account.  I should have bought a $300 Acer like my wife.  About all I have is an $1100 door stop.
+	Love my laptop! "Refurbished" but definitely seems no less than brand new. You can't really go wrong with a Mac, but maybe I could've found a better price if I looked longer. Either way I've had no issues for 6 months and I'm happy!
-	Simply a extra weight and keep crashing, 8bg RAM will be eaten by all junk applications could be windows issues
-	This system is very stylish and light weight.But it failed after only 40 days of use and would shut off at random periods.  It was not damaged in any way by me but ACER was a pain in the butt to deal with for tech support.  They wanted me to prove that I had not damaged it rather than them showing me that I had.They finally agreed to a repair it if I paid to ship it to them.All in all...the computer is MEH...not bad for the price but nothing to write home about.  Had it not failed I would give it 3 stars.  But after failing and having to deal with the India based tech support from hell...1 star is generous.
+	I love my MacBookPro. It is fast, easy to use and no viruses. I have other laptops stacked up like cord wood. I will never go back. Keep up the good work. Thanks John
-	When we received this laptop my teenaged son was very happy since it was his Christmas gift but that happiness turned into frustration very fast. The battery never charged! We left it charging 12 hours as indicated before using it but the charge level never got above 3%. Now the battery is dead after less than two weeks use. Definitely it's a lemon. On top of this ASUS is not answering our emails and the local company in Honduras in charge of giving service to ASUS laptops is saying ASUS is refusing the guarantee because we took the laptop out of the USA! I thought laptops where designed to travel so service and guarantees should be international as is the case with DELL. Very disappointed.
-	After living with the Aspire S7 for 5 months, I cannot recommend it to anyone except perhaps my worst enemies.At first I was excited about its light weight, and its stylish form factor. But I have since learned that these come at way too high a cost.The keyboard is basically unusable. Because the laptop is so thin, there's almost no key travel, which means keystrokes are often missed or accidentally doubled. After five months I still have not found a way to be accurate typing on this thing. The touchpad is also tricky, though I'm not sure what causes it to be so.Out of the box, the wireless is a serious mess. Major issues getting connected to a most of the different networks I use, and I'm still not confident that I've got it squared away.Also, it seems minor, but has been a big issue: the placement of the power button on the side is exactly where you would put your hand to pick it up. So I'm always accidentally turning it off when I want to shift in my seat. Seriously, I turned it off while writing this review.I went with an Acer rather than an HP in the hopes that the machine wouldn't be bogged down with bloatware. Sadly, this is not the case. Acer has all of their own tools they'd like me to be using; who knows how many conflicts they cause with Windows 8. I did eventually uninstall some Acer app that seems to have fixed a persistent crash, but it took a long time to troubleshoot.The touchscreen has so much glare, I find myself twisting and turning in an attempt to find a position where it can be seen.And, it's a small thing, but it only comes with one charger - evidently an uncommon charger as it took me forever to find a backup. None of the chargers on Amazon seem to actually fit it, so I had to buy it directly from Acer.So the only time I like this laptop is when it is turned off, and in my backpack. Any other time it is a source of constant frustration and diminished productivity.
-	Lenovo ships from China and while you wait and wait for delivery the price will drop.  Lenovo's price match offers to pay you the difference if you submit an identical Lenovo quote within a certain number of days.  Lots of luck making the quote and your order identical.  ANY discrepancy will result in denial of the entire refund and you will not be told that there is a discrepancy in time for you to resubmit.  This will happen even if you were told by a Lenovo agent on submission that you should receive a refund of the difference in price!  This behavior will be cited as Lenovo Policy.  The PC itself is not worth the bother of dealing with Lenovo and its policy.
-	I love most everything about the Lenovo Yoga except the terrible WiFi implementation.  The Yoga wireless problems run the gamut of slow response to the even more irritating failure to reconnectThe Lenovo Yoga is a clever design with a quality look and feel, but a mobile device with a faulty wireless implementation is extremely frustrating at best.  Adding to the frustration is the fact that this wireless problem has been widely known for many months as evidenced by lengthy threads on the Lenovo forums with no discernible actions, explanations, or solutions forthcoming from Lenovo.I have tried installing the latest LAN drivers from the Lenovo support site, but the new drivers actually made the problems worse.  For the present, I have worked around the problem by installing a USB wireless transceiver on my Yoga.  There have been many other workarounds proposed on the Lenovo forums, but this workaround seems to be the only thing that reliably avoids the problem.If the internal WiFi functioned reliably, I would rank the Yoga with 5 stars. However, the wireless problems ruin what would otherwise be a fine product.
+	This product is amazing and it is really a wonderful experience to use this im going into high school and im a tech kid and i do a lot of movie editing so this laptop was right for me i love this laptop i recommend this to anyone looking for nice size laptop for some editing surfing the web and games i love this macbook pro
-	Windows 8 is the AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I would not have purchase this if I knew how bad windows 8 is. DO NOT buy anything with windows 8!
-	I bought this at another retailer for $500.  Not worth it.  It developed a hard drive problem after owning it for four months.  It needed to have a new hard drive installed, with all the problems and hassles that come with that process.  I'm still not sure it will last.  Do not buy this computer; do research, and pay a few hundred more dollars upfront to avoid the problem.  The tech who looked at the machine said he's seen this model develop hard drive problems within weeks of purchase.
-	This computer had several errors in it that made it shut down. We returned this computer to you. Not a good computer!
-	Has been nothing but trouble since I bought it. I have had this a little over a year and I already need to replace it, and all I use it for isItunes and writing papers for college. Even had the hard drive replaced. Worthless laptop and terrible HP customer service, plus Geek Squad knows pretty much nothing. Never buying HP again. I should have known better, my sister has had two and they are junk as well. Buyer beware.
+	I've had this  laptop for almost 2 years and i love it.I bought for about $450.00 at best buy and it fits my needs and does everything i want it to do, games, downloads, videos etc. It has a nice feel to it but its a bit heavy. its great for browsing the web and maybe some occasional gaming.pros-fast and responsivegreat feelperfect for home usecons-not exactly portablea bit heavyI mainly use programs such as adobe after effects, adobe premier, Photoshop, Sony Vegas, and hit-film.its also great for games like, skyrim, fallout new Vegas, Call of duty, and battlefield.so far those are really the only games I've tried on the laptop and they work pretty decently.Overall its a great laptop and i would recommend it to many.
+	This is the first MAC I've ever purchased, and it lives up to its popularity. Very user friendly for even the most computer challenged.
+	This computer is excellent, i will be an apple fan a little bit longer, no more slow startups and blue screens. I really recommend this product.
+	Bought it at a great price from Amazon Warehouse. Called Apple and they reset the original warranty to the date I purchased it.Couldn't be happier with the computer or Amazon Warehouse - price, quality and service.
+	Product is to beware bad pornographic influences.  But why not tell the consumer.  Life is good with the MacBook.  Victor Tay
+	I've had this massive screened beauty for 4-months now with not a single glitch! I replaced a 15" Dell XPS, and this larger screen size is very welcomed. Here are some observations:1. Sheer size. This laptop is in the category of DTR (desk top replacement). In other words, this machine is large enough to feel like an acceptable replacement to a full blown desktop system. The beauty of a DTR is how much cleaner your desk will look with the laptop open or closed.2. The screen is bright and beautiful. The glass covers nearly the entire lid and there is a 1/2" black framing under the glass on the sides and bottom. The framing is slightly larger on the top where the web-cam resides.3. The lid operates solidly. It does not have a wobbly feel. The hinge is tight enough that when you open the laptop, you have to hold down the lower half of the machine - as if you are prying the two halves apart.4. The keyboard is full size and includes a ten-key number pad. The keys are what is called 'chicklett' style. The keys operate properly but I am still not used to the unique arrangement of some of the key. Especially annoying are the dedicated half-size directional arrow keys. I could turn off the NumLock and use those arrows, but I use numbers a lot. The back-lit keyboard is a first for me, and I like it a lot!5. This machine does play (but not burn) BluRay. (Honestly, blank BD disks are still expensive. An external USB drive is a better method of data storage.) Also plays and burns DVD & CD. This optical drive is a tray loader. I prefer slot loading only because when I have the tray extended I always feel like I could accidentally break it.6. The sound system is incredible! Six speakers including a sub-woofer. When watching a movie on this computer I'm about 3-feet from the screen, and the picture quality and great sound are in competition with my large screen HDTV and THX sound system. It's that good.7. Of the 5 USB ports, one is USB 3.0 which allows my primary backup drive to do it's job in a fraction of the time compared to USB 2.0.8. Because of the sheer size, I will not be hauling this around on a regular basis. I have a netbook that I carry to school. But I did want to have a case for this machine for those rare occasions. Again, because it's to big, finding a case took hours of searching! Here is the model I found that I purchased. Cut and paste this into Amazon's search bar: Everki Advance Laptop Bag - Briefcase, Fits up to 18.4-Inch (EKB407NCH18). (I wrote a review on that case - love it.)9. The machine connects rapidly to wi-fi. There is an easy access dedicated button on the front left edge of the device that instantly brings up the wi-fi and bluetooth toggles.10. The bottom line for me when selecting this machine was company reputation and price. The laptop has perfectly handled all the heavy processing digital media editing and processing software that I have installed. Not a single burp in four months.I would feel comfortable recommending this machine to any friend or relative seeking a DTR. In the realm of 18"+ screens, the market is still narrow. You could go with another manufacturer and pay more. Just compare the specifications and make your own wise decision.
-	I bought a Toshiba E55 at Best Buy because I wanted wireless 802.11 AC back in February.  The touch pad looks identical to the touchpad in the E55 photo here - a single slab.All my other 4 laptops in my family have a button for left click, a button for right click and the touchpad.  So three surfaces.This E55 is now going in for service a THIRD time because the computer thinks the left mouse (part of the slab) is clicked.  Point is I can slide the mouse pointer around and the computer thinks there was a click when there wasn't.  Perhaps 20 time per hour.I am not leaning on it. I am not pushing on it.  When you do push down on the bottom left corner of the slab, you hear an audible click. You had the tactile feel of a click. But none of that for these "ghost" clicks.  The repair notes say both times that the problem was replicated and that they fixed it.  All I can say is that I take it out of the shipping box and it is not fixed.  I'm beginning to think this single slab is a design flaw.Also, when it came back from service, the backlit keyboard no longer works, the shiny bezel around the screen has vertical scratched lines on both sides, about 4 inches long about 1/2 inch from the outside edge.  There is also some gouging  of the bezel in the bottom right corner.  Also the Intel sticker to the left of the touchpad was first torn off and then left barely hanging.Even more frustrating is the Toshiba repair call center.  For the most part, they got adequate training in our version of English. But try to fathom this.  The computer comes back from service in a box.  I call to get it repaired a 2nd and now 3rd time, but this perfectly good box I have in hand can't be used again, I have to wait 3-5 business days for another box?  We know how Amazon let's us just print a prepaid label immediately to send things back, but Toshiba not only is wasteful, but make us wait that extra time just to send it in.  Because I bought at Best Buy, I couldn't return it after 17 days as a typical buyer.  My fault there.  When sold and shipped by Amazon you get 30 days to exchange.What's also frustrating  about Best Buy is looking at MOST of their 1 or 2 star reviews it is transparent that there are trolls who go through and mark these reviews "Not Helpful" simply because they had criticism of the product.Next time I will wait for the features I want to be available on Amazon, and sold by Amazon.
+	The best laptop I have ever had; I am using computers since 1970 from the IBM mainframes thru Windows PC and then laptop, but got tired of freezing, virus, etc. and decided to change to Mac (now have iPod, iPhone and Macbook Pro). My last one have Win7, 4GbRAM, 320GbHD and everything else for an updated laptop, but soon after I bought it start the same problems; now this is for far a state of the art one, nice looking, very small and lightweight, robust hardware and excellent operating system. I will never change to Windows, it worth the money I paid, I recommend it.
+	the relation of price and quality is excellent, basic use of software, internet, office, watch movies on TV or in some proyetor is great.
-	Worked 3 days beautifully and then died completely.  Called HP tech and they said return.  Will order Acer in january.
+	I don't know much about computer and I've never used a mac before. My old PC isn't working so I think it's time for a change. I originally wanted the fancier one of the 13 inch model but my budget is tight. So I went with the cheapest pro (the i5 processor with 500 gb HDD). I ordered it on Friday and I selected the next day shipping. I got my new mac in the early morning on Saturday! Good job, amazon! I spent a day playing with it to get familiar with the new os. And I am amazed! It's pretty, high quality, and fast. Highly recommend!
+	I can't say enough about the excellent design and ease of use of this machine. I was reluctant to switch to a laptop that lacks an optical drive but now that I've tried it, there's no going back. The slim, lightweight design, iPad-like instant-on of all solid-state storage and superior battery life make this laptop a dream to use. It took me a day or two to fully adapt to the Mac OS X Lion operating system but now I love it. You can't go wrong with this pleasing and delightful computer.
+	This is my second 17 i12RM and I love them.  Both are working far better than I had expected.  Dell has quality that goes without saying and this laptop seems to be exactly what a home user would want.
-	My HP laptop has great features, but also has a jumping cursor problem when I type which destroys productivity.  HP has had this computer back for repairs 3 times, but has not been able to fix the problem.  They have no record of my first two calls to technical support and have refused to give me a full refund on this computer which has never worked properly.  Needless to say, I'll never buy from them again!
-	i used this for one day and it was working fine. the next day i turned it on used it for maybe an hour and then out of no where it started to make this weird noise and i got a blue screen. so i restarted the laptop and on the boot screen is "says automatic repair"then it restarts my computer saying it has an error trying to fix it. so i turn it on again and the same thing happens over and over....called amazon customer care the first time got me a refund. but the next dday i called again about my laptop another lady actually help this time and sent me a replacement.... im hoping i dont get another defected item or i would regret buying my first asus laptop..
-	My company purchased 2 units because we're reaching our refresh cycle on our user machines and are thinking about switching to one of the new ultra books since we travel significantly and they're specs are more than enough for the typical user and the weight is a great benefit. They come with a fair amount of branded junk on them, but no worse than anything else from other manufacturers. We purchased the model with the core I7 (1.7GHz), 124Gb SSD, 4GB RAM and at the time was shipping with windows 7 home premium. the first unit was configured and is running with no problems, but the second unit has an issue with the display so that the on board screen only shows random colorbars, but the unit sends an image to an external monitor correctly. If you do purchase a unit not running windows professional or higher, you'll need to either upgrade your version to be able to join your network or if you have a corporate license, wipe the machine and do a fresh install. We have a corporate key, but microsoft won't allow you to use a corporate key on the upgrade anytime feature so I purchased another key. The 1st machine has been in use for about 1 month thus far with no complaints (running office, vpn software, corporate antivirus suite and a few other corporate apps). I'm waiting on a response from tech support about handling the unit with the malfunctioning screen (I just began the build yesterday so it's only been 24 hours since I submitted the complaint). If all goes well with the handling of either repairing or swapping the unit then we may purchase more so I'll have a larger sample size for observation. One minor problem is that the SSDs that came in the units were formatted using GUID instead of MBR and the encryption software I normally deploy only supports MBR, so it looks like I'll be giving bitlocker a try. On a side note, I also own a Samsung Series 9 (one of my personals) and I have zero complaints thus far with that unit.To follow up my earlier review I will lower my rating of these units and say they definitely shouldn't be used in a business environment. My company purchased 6 units total and here's a list of issues:1. screws fell out of the bottom of unit #1 (cosmetic, but speaks to build quality)2. unit #2 had a screen problem upon arrival and had to be sent back to have the onboard screen replaced (took about 7 months to get the unit back) also had power supply die after a few months of use which I replaced with a store brand, has been fine since.3. Unit #3 has an issue causing the display to flicker and has lost the ability to output video to a 2nd monitor (it's the unit, not the adaptor).4. the adaptor that is used to connect to a 2nd monitor has malfunctioned on unit #45. unit #5 went into a sleep/hibernation state and will not restart so it needs to be sent in for repair.6. unit #6 has been problem free.Based on that I cannot recommend these machines and our company has already switched to the Dell Latitude 6430u.
-	I loved it until motherboard failed. I had my IT service contact Asus and still have not heard from them other than service #. I did fax in my record of purchase from Amazon. I need this fixed I'm a doctor on electronic medical records. Did hear back and sent in for repair, still waiting.  12/12/13
+	Never ever ever going back to PC....EVER! Received it super fast & this item alone has made me a huge Amazon customer for life. Great price & everything you could ask for. I really love how all of my apple products are now seamless together.
-	First, this is the first time in 2 years with amazon that I'm writing a review but I feel like I should warn others. Be prepared to return this item for issues, read the 1 and 2 star reviews. I bought this ultrabook during cyber monday as part of their $200giftcard promo with purchase. I own the Asus Transformer 1st gen with dock and it's been great so I figured I'd go with Asus for my ultrabook too. Bad idea.When I received my item, it was awesome to behold. It is really thin closed and looks really good. I then turn on the laptop and on the windows bootup screen you will instantly notice the light bleed, for me it was across all the edges. I figured this is an Asus issue because my transformer tablet has the same issue. I was going to let that slide until I noticed that in the top center there was an area with dead pixels..It was only visible when you had a black being displayed across the screen, but it bugged me to no end so I had to return it.Just received my 2nd replacement and still had light bleed on edges but again no big deal for me. As I was setting up Windows though I noticed that certain keys failed to register, all along the right side of keyboard: -,=,Enter,P,L,M, and SPACE. None of these keys worked but I figure maybe it's software, checked for latest drivers but nope this was a hardware issue. I then checked the amazon 1 and 2 star reviews and I noticed people have had similar issues with multiple returns. 5 minutes later I tried the keys again and they worked! 10 minutes after that they stopped again!After reading all of the negative reviews with multiple returns. I think Asus has a QA problem with these ultrabooks. In summary, I really wanted to like this laptop, and perhaps if I had been lucky, as others have, I would keep it. I'm sending it back again and not going to bother for a 3rd replacement in hopes that it will work.
+	As always, apple has done again, really neat laptop. my wife is thrill with it enjoing it and makeing the most out of it.
-	I just bought this item for my friend. But I found something is wrong when my friend received and showed me. The hard driver just 360GB, no fingerprint. It's totally different from what the seller wrote omline.
-	I was really anticipating the arrival of my laptop. When it finally got to me I was so excited until I turned it on using my friend's charger, the display is cracked and bleeding through SO much that the computer is completely nonfunctional. I am more than disappointed since I've been emailing the seller and have only gotten two replies that still don't answer my question. I needed a computer within a certain time range considering the one my family was using stopped working and now all I have is another broken device. This review itself is being typed on my mother's phone.
-	So this laptop can apparently come with two different types of hard drives (both 256 gig ssds). If you buy this laptop, you will either get the Sandisk U100 or the ADATA MX11. An uninformed consumer probably wouldn't know or care what the difference between these two drives are, but they should!The Sandisk U100 has the worst write speeds of current SSDs. The Zenbook prime I ordered was horribly slow at transferring files because of this. When I took the laptop back to the retailer, I requested an exchange for one with the ADATA MX11 hard drive. I was told by the retailer that there is no way to tell which hard drive you will get without opening the retail packaging. Note that opening the retail packaging renders the product used.I feel Asus should put the hard drive brand on the outside of the box so that consumers can make a proper informed decision. The ADATA MX11 outperforms the Sandisk U100 in every way and this can be seen in performance tests when comparing the two.I would not recommend anyone purchase this at this time. At least until Asus is more forthcoming about which SSD they are putting in this Zenbook.Update.Well I must say this has been a pretty horrible experience, and I'm never buying an Asus product again.The screws on the laptop keep falling out. I am now missing 2 of them and the only way to get them replaced is to ship it to Asus. I any afford to do that as I need to have a computer for school and work.The hard drive performance is painfully slow, and of course Asus won't replace the drive.My best advice to anyone thinking of purchasing this device or any Asus product is to avoid at all costs.
-	Received my new MacBook Air today -- turned it on, and couldn't even get past the 3rd startup screen before the machine froze.  It began getting buggy on the second page, and now it is simply stuck without any options (the battery is internal, so I can't remove and start over again).  Very expensive trash.For someone who had just put his toe over the line in terms of converting to Apple from PC, my recommendation to anyone considering is DON'T.  The machine would be more effective as a door stop.I'm typing this from my husband's $400 Toshiba Satellite -- save yourself the money and hassle and buy yourself one of those.
-	Same hardware defect happened for 3 new laptops - audio input/output device no longer detected.- After 30 days, the audio broke.  Apple shipped me a new one.- After 7 days, the audio broke.  Apple shipped me a second new one.- After 1 hour, the audio broke.  With Apple support now - probably returning this.Root cause: I believe it is a hardware design problem.  My speakers (Arctic S111) are powered via USB.  Seems the speaker drains the voltage causing the nearby audio card to break.  That's my running theory.I DON'T recommend buying this laptop - unless you like to waste your time with support and geniuses who spend 5 seconds to verify it is a defect.
+	when i bought this computer it looked wonderful because i knew what i was buying, this dell latitude was made for professional and educational work, when i began using this laptop i erased the windows vista it had and put a fresh copy of windows 7 professional. this computer has been by far the best laptop i've ever owned, i have always purchased from dell and dell never lets me down because i knew what i want. i work as a real pc tech and i know what im in for.the laptop contains 2 wwan slots, capability for cellular data, extra wifi cards, gps, you name it. It also contains 4 usb slots, bluetooth, 14.1 inch wxga lcd screen, 6lbs body weight, interchangeble cd drive to put hdd or other items in the cd-rw slot. also hd speakers capible of reaching 24,bit 192000 hz studio quality sound. s video port for tv, i 1394 port. vga port for external lcd. ethernet and modem port, headphone & mic port. the original battery lasts me 4 hrs on full use using windows 7 pro. my E5400 has been with me a whole year since i have owned this laptop and it has never let me down ever. i even went camping with it and traveled with it also, and my friends always expect for my laptop to die out on me and never has it crashed or physically broken or nothin. the body on this laptop isnt ugly it's called having a secure strong body frame built to last, i'm constantly using this latitude for work and home and it still runs smooth as from day one. people who have a school version, don't assume the pc itself is crap because it's not. on this type of computer the bad work is not on the physical parts of the laptop its the software that runs it. most of the time schools or education places purchase this model of computer because it was designed for easy (IT) networking, meaning that the pc can be controlled and maintained by some lazy fat guy sitting behind a desk and work on it. In my opinion this pc is for the feint hearted and people who are ready to physical demand on the pc. I purchased this pc directly from dell.com because this series is not availible at retail stores. :D very good battery life on this type of dell model
+	Great power-house of a laptop. I don't do much gaming, but it can handle what few games I did throw at it. The keyboard is fantastic, yet as with many laptops, takes a bit of getting used to with respect to they layout of things. The only reasons this laptop is getting a 4/5 from me are because of the 5400rpm hard drive. It really feels like the bottleneck for the machine, which isn't too noticeable, but it would increase the speed of loading the OS and applications. An easy "fix". Also, the touchpad isn't so great. Maybe I haven't found the exact settings I need yet, but I can't seem to get it to cooperate 100%. It's still jumpy. I mostly use a mouse anyway, but to use the laptop without a mouse I can foresee as being incredibly frustrating.
+	The apple  was the best price anywhere. It arrived on time and packaged well. It is a new experience but easy to learn. Phone help is $100.  We read the book and understand the computer without help. When we needed to print the apple located the Epson workforce 445. I learned to scan to the apple after we put the Epson disc in. It was a fast process. slow scanning but that is the Epson. It cost more but it is living up to our expectation.
-	I was pretty excited to get new notebook for decent price. The title "HP Envy dv6 Laptop(Latest Model)" is suspicious by itself what exactly is "latest model" is questionable, however configuration seemed fine so I went for it. When I got the package the computer box was also weird, no HP sticker seal and after closer look fingerprints on the notebook plus somebody was clearly messing with whole comp by unscrewing all screws - visible wear of paint. As I was expecting brand new machine sending this one back right away as used one would be $100 cheaper.
+	Purchased a month before the new one came out.  Got a better deal because of it.  Love the computer.  Mainly browse the internet. Have done some projects in iPhoto but overall love it.  Would recommend this to others.
+	This is the first mac I owe, but i simply love it. I've already have it for more than a year and a half, but did not have any problems with it. Moreover, I was able to extend its memory from 4GB to 8GB easily by myself at home.
-	I ordered a SL510 -- received it damaged.  Returned and got another. This one would not connect to wi-fi.  Called many times with no help.  Returned for repair THREE times and still did not work for more than a couple days at a time.  Got my son to do a temp. fix but the unit still keeps dropping the Wi-Fi connection and shuts down on me at any time it feels like. (Lenovo said it did all it could and I now had the unit beyond warranty.)I had an IBM Thinkpad that was great, but the Lenovo is a piece of garbage.  I'll never buy a Lenovo product again!
+	I bought this Toshiba about a year ago and it is the best laptop I have had. After you have used it for a while you will know what I'm talking about. The speed for the amount of memory amazed me. My roommate has a laptop with 3GB Ram and it is no faster. She was upset because she paid more and has better stats but my laptop is better. Her DVD drive also went out after 6 months of use. This Toshiba is quality. I have never had a problem with it and even though its a little older it runs like new. Decent screen display for a older computer but still not what you will get on a new $800 dollar laptop. Sound quality is decent and gets pretty loud. It just feels sturdy when you use it. It stays much cooler than most laptops under heavy use as well which may have a lot to do with its longevity. I think for the money you couldn't ask for more. If you are looking for a good day to day laptop look no further.
-	I got this and had to return the 1st one cause it wouldnt turn on...Had to pay return shipping and got the new one a week later the new one doesnt turn on or do anything....Do not waste your time...
-	Bought this computer 4 months ago and have had frequent issues like over heating, touchy touch pad and screen freezing. The construction is also subpar in that if you rest your hands on the rest area on either side of the touch pad the computer flexes and causes the touch pad to have issues. Now the touch pad is out totally and the touch screen is acting up. This is my work computer so I can't afford the down time. It's cute but not made we'll. my wife has an apple computer Mac air...no problems. I have had to spend 6 calls and a dozen hours on the phone only to have to try to resolve the issue by resetting my computer and wiping out all my data...I fortunately have it backed up.So the bottom line is if you want cute and want someone to talk to for hours get the Lenovo yoga.
-	I was quite excited to get this, since it's kind of a cross between an iPad and a laptop.  Windows 8 is horrible!  The laptop is actually great!  I blame Microsoft, not HP.  I spent hours and hours trying to get the email function to work. I also tried to join this laptop to a home group to share a printer.  It did join the homegroup, but then it could not see the printer, even though I have other Windows devices sharing the same printer on the same homegroup.  Everything is difficult to use from simply closing a window to changing to another application.  After you download the applications that you might use like Amazon, Facebook, etc. the icons have scrolling messages that don't say what the application is.  You have to figure out that the tiny letter A in the bottom corner is Amazon, while the entire icon is giving you scrolling shopping messages.  It's the same thing with email or any other application.  It doesn't come with Office either, that costs a lot extra.  After days of google searches to guide me through even the basics on this computer, I finally gave up and sent it back.
-	Ever wanted to test the dreaded blue screen of death feature in a Windows notebook, look no further.  This machine comes with Vista home basic and crashed ever 5 mins, even when I would fix the driver issues.  Then I upgraded to Vista home Premium which made the system more stable for internet use but still crashed an insane amount of times.  I now use a Dell XPS which is flawless, a Macbook Pro which I have had for a year and a new 24" Imac, which  have yet to fail or error a single time.  Avoid the Dell Inspiron (this make of Inspiron anyway) it's a waste of time and money.  The hard drive's are garbage and the wireless cards used in this notebook and the XPS are terrible, zone out and fail in a month.  The keyboard is comfortable, alot like the Latitude keyboard but cheaper, and the dvd rom is brittle, flimsey junk.  Overall this is just a terrible computer in every sence.  It looks nice, with a nice design but it's a wolf in sheeps clothing, it's garbage.Highly recommend everyone avoid this notebook.
+	Good computer, no problems...and this is coming from a mac lover....too bad they dont have this no more...i was trying to buy a 2nd one
+	Excellent purchase. Perfect delivery. MacBook Pro speaks for itself. Everything works out with no effort at all. The best operating system and the best hardware and design.
+	I have the 500GB/2.4GHz Core i5 version. The hardware quality alone makes it worth the price, and MAC OS X Lion adds another layer of excellence.As others have said, the attention to detail in the hardware is superb, most notably the aluminium unibody chassis, the vivid LCD screen (1280 x 800), the panel hinge and the unsurpassed trackpad. The baseline Macbook Pro represented here is a beautifully engineered embodiment of the Intel Sandy Bridge mobile platform with integrated HD 3000 graphics.I have a few minor negatives to share, but nothing that would warrant docking a star from the rating:1) You won't be getting iWeb or iDVD as part of the iLife package pre-installed with the machine. You still get iMovie and Garageband, though.2) 4GB of memory is on the edge of being too little, depending on how many applications you are apt to leave open during a working day. You may be glad that it is easy to upgrade the RAM on this machine to 8GB.3) The integrated graphics are weaker than the previously supported nVidia discrete graphics in the Core 2 Duo MacBooks. You now have to step up to the 15" Macbooks to get a machine suitable for graphics-intensive tasks (other than video encoding and playback). But, unless you use your machine for gaming or 3-d animations you are unlikely to miss the graphics prowess of a discrete GPU.These days Windows has gained much of the stability and usability that used to be the sole province of Mac OS, so the preference for Mac OS is less compelling than it once was. Nevertheless, the use of a large, ergonomic trackpad with reliable and accurate gesture recognition *built into the OS* is a wonderful thing, and not easy to give up once you've experienced it. Windows 8 may take that distinction away as well, but so far I've not come across PC hardware good enough to make the experience as complete as it is with currently is with a late 2011 Macbook.
-	This laptop is sold as a NEW item, but actually was a REFURBISHED one...I brought the computer into France, so that made everything very complicated...I got problems from day 1, and when I tried to get help from The Computer Upgrade King, I had to call at least 10 times before someone gets on the phone. And after very little help from TCUK, nothing had changed.I tried calling Dell... There, they told me I could not be helped either, because the computer was registered under someone else's name (not specified) and I had to fill a form to change it (nothing difficult, but it would take 14 days). And that the computer actually wasn't new, it was a refurbished one. (If I knew that before, I would have never spent $1300 in a refurbished one)At the end, after around 2 weeks, I had to send it back.Bottom line... Don't buy this laptop from them. I ordered the same one from another seller, and I'm happy with it, although the WiFi problem is there! Do NOT believe that you will be the lucky one without it.
-	I purchased this laptop 2 years ago directly from Lenova. They no longer carry it so I can't write a review on their website, but I wanted to make sure someone knew of the issues I've had with this laptop.I've used Lenova laptops at work and have not had any issues with them. That's why I bought a Lenova laptop for my daughter. In two years with this, I've had to send it back to Lenova during the 1-year warranty period for hard drive issues. I've had to take it in to be repaired to an indenpent dealer twice because of slowness and other performance  issues. Currently, the hard drive is not responding and needs to be replaced. Also, there headphone jack is loose and we have to tape the headphone cord into the socket for it to be used. I will not buy a Lenova laptop again. It's been very disappointing.
-	The computer its running very well. But battery just charge till 60% and says plugged in, not charging. Nobody help me with a solution.
+	Great laptop with fast shipping. Everything I expected. I recommend this product. Easy to set up and quick as lightning.
-	I have been extremely disappointed with my Toshiba Satellite laptop.  After one year the hard drive failed.  It was a complete waste of money.  Toshiba customer service is horrible!!  The worst customer service I have ever experienced.  I will never buy one of their products again.  They do not stand behind their products and a laptop should last more than one year.  My previous laptop lasted over 5 years.  So, choose another brand and you will be better off.
-	I am stuck with a computer that weighs 10 pounds.  The people would not take it back unless they took a 30 to 50 percent re-stocking fee! They look good up front but once you have to deal with them it is a different story. Amazon will not back you up either. I will not buy even from Amazon anymore! This company cost me a lot of money!This is a true report!
-	Very slow starting and loading.  Windows 8 is hampered by slow response.  Insulted by on screen note that says the power supply furnished with the computer is not the best one and that I would get better performance by buying an upgraded power supply.
-	Toshiba low-end laptops are pure garbage. Flimsy, cheap, unreliable, and built with the cheapest components available. Save your money and spend a bit more on something else not built by Toshiba. Best case scenario, you might get 6-12 months out of your laptop before things start to fail. Worse case scenario (as I've just experienced), your laptop will last a matter of weeks before the lights go out. And unfortunately for the buyer, Toshiba often refuses to meet their own warranty obligations. Considering how cheap the laptops are, they don't want to help you, or fix the laptop. They would lose money otherwise. So if you send it in for repairs, like they'll inevitably recommend, you'll find yourself being asked to pay elaborate sums of money because the 'scope of work' is not within the boundaries of the original warranty agreement. This of course is not true. Toshiba is simply trying to force the added costs of warranty repairs down the throats of uninformed customers. Their laptops are cheap, but they won't actually save you any money in the long run.Save your money. Don't buy Toshiba. Consider any laptops made by Toshiba as being purely disposable, or built for third word countries with no consumer protection laws.
-	I ordered this computer based on the Amazon production that this computer had a 8x DVD/RWANDA drive. When I received the computer it did not include this drive at all. Very misleading production description by Amazon. I phoned customer service and they understood my issue. They emailed me a return authorization label to print out so I could take to UPS to return for full refund. Amazon was great on the return and credited my credit card for the full amount including shipping within 3 days.
+	nice laptop for the money am having  bit of problems with wireless connection sometimes like another customer had said it sometimes is slow to connect other than that great value for the money do my surfing email small projects and games and have no problems am still new to this OS and being an only windows user from the start I find I really like Ubuntu it is simple straight forward and easy to learn so if you want an in expensive laptop that gets reg jobs and hobbies done this should do it for you have fun  know I am
+	I recently made the switch from PC to Mac, and I can say that I'm not sure why I waited so long.  Considering that I have only had my computer a few weeks I can't say much about the durability and longevity of the hardware, but I can say that the operating system (mine shipped with Lion) and software is top notch.I labored for a long time trying to decide whether the 13" MacBook Pro (MBP) or MacBook Air was the right choice for me.  I liked the form factor, screen resolution and weight of the Air, but couldn't get comfortable with the comparatively small hard drive and the RAM fixed at 4GB.  Considering these factors along with the significant price premium for an Air, I decided that the MBP was right for me.I also thought long and hard about whether to go with the base model with the 2.4Ghz i5 processor and 500 GB HDD or the 2.8Ghz i7 processor with the 750GB HDD.  after looking at reviews and benchmark tests I decided that for my uses, the less expensive model would be perfect and that the incremental added performance of the more expensive model is not worth the additional cost.  When large solid state drives become more affordable I will probably switch my HDD out, but until then 500GB should provide plenty of storage.I opted to get my computer locally, but purchased the Crucial 8GB Kit (4GBx2), 204-pin SODIMM, DDR3 PC3-10600 Memory Module (CT2KIT51264BC1339) from Amazon for a great price.  Once I got my computer home I installed the RAM in 10 minutes, start to finish.  If you are planning this upgrade just be sure that you have the right Phillips head screwdriver.After using this computer for the past few weeks and carrying it on weekly business trips I am very pleased with my choice of computers.  It handles the Microsoft office suite flawlessly, and the added ram allows me to open and view very large pdf files without any lag.  I have done minor video and photo editing on this computer and it performed very well.  The added weight compared to theAir hasn't proven to be too noticeable, but I am a big guy at 6'4" and 210 pounds.So far I am pleased with this computer and my Mac experience overall.  The process of learning a new OS and overall user interface was daunting at first, but Apple has done a great job creating a system that is intuitive and easy to learn.I would recommend this computer to anyone looking for a new laptop that they expect to have for awhile and would like to be able to customize to fit their needs.UPDATE 5/29/12: I have been using my MBP for six months now and couldn't be happier with it.  I may have been lucky enough to get a great unit, but during the time that I have owned my MBP I have NEVER needed to contact technical support.  I use my Mac for my primary business computer every day and have traveled extensively with it.Aside from its performance and reliability the feature that I like most about my Mac is the multi-touch trackpad.  By using gestures on the trackpad I can be very efficient, and I'm not sure that I will ever be able to go back to a regular mouse or trackball.One addition that I made was to get the Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter MB570Z/A to attach a second monitor when I'm at the office.  This allows me to use both my MBP monitor and an external, which provides me with much more area when using Excel or other programs and also allows me to keep my mailbox visible when working on other things.Considering how pleased I am with my Mac, I have a feeling that I will be buying a lot more Apple products in the future.
-	Regardless of the make or model of Toshiba laptop you possess, good luck getting any action out of Toshiba customer no-service.  After a solid month of dealing with them I have concluded that they have no intention of honoring their agreement, made that the time I purchased my laptop to repair or replace my laptop, a Toshiba Satellite L675 D,should it be defective.  My screen started blinking and flashing less than one month after I purchased it.  After following Toshiba's instructions to do various things to address the situation, I started getting hard drive failure warnings, followed by the dreaded blue screen.  At that point, I dutifully shipped off my laptop to the repair depot.  After ten days turned into 3 weeks, I called to see why my machine was still in limbo.  I was informed that they had put it on hold for parts.  My subsequent phone inquiry elicited an excuse that a parts hold extends their repair time frame by 7 to 10 days.  The rep was actually counting off the days on his fingers.  When he got to 10 and realized that his excuse no longer held water, he apologized and said that he would e-mail someone to find out what the delay was, and he would "call me back immediately."  Ten days later, after nothing had changed, I called again. I was informed by a supervisor that my laptop was put on a new hold on December the 5th, and that there was no other remedy available to me. Basically, if I didn't like it, tough.  there's no-one else to talk to, and if I complain to Toshiba corporate or post on a board like this one, they could care less.  I told him that he had lost a customer, and he basically kissed me off and hung up.  Please take this under consideration when you consider purchasing any Toshiba product.  I am going to.
+	First, a little background. Aside from a TI-99 we had when I was a kid and the Apple IIc computers at my middle school, I've always been a Windows guy. I feel very comfortable in the Windows environment and have been building my own PCs for about 15 years. I don't hate Microsoft. But when the need for another laptop became clear, I decided to focus my search on the higher end machines. I wanted good horsepower, but I especially wanted a nicer form factor than the creaky Dells I had become accustomed to. As I had fallen in love with the interface on my iPhone, I decided it was time to give MacBooks a try. I kept my Windows desktop in case I ran into compatibility problems.The short version of that story is that I quickly dismantled my PC and now use this laptop as my only machine. I am fortunate to be able to do so because my work as an attorney requires only Word, Excel, and an internet browser. As a bonus, my copy of Lightroom 3 also installed on the MacBook. I'm trying not to sound like a Mac zealot, so let's have a list:-Aluminum unibody is no marketing gimmick. It's sturdy and feels great with no flex and no creaking. Looks nice, too.-Keyboard is well-engineered. The key travel and spacing between keys feel just right for my taste. There is no flex here, either, which I often find disconcerting on other laptops.-Trackpad is a marvel. It really is. It's very large, but I've yet to feel like it's in the way. And the finger movements are intuitive and work very well.-The screen is bright, clear and has great color. The reflectivity is sometimes an issue in bright locations, but I find tilting it a little solves most problems. Otherwise, you can custom order the anti-glare screen direct from Apple.-The lid closes with a magnet, so there's nothing to break.-It is very fast. In my experience, Mac OS X starts up and shuts down far faster than a comparably spec'ed Windows machine. I have yet to feel a need for 8 GB of RAM, but an upgrade would only cost $90 if you know how to do it yourself. Otherwise, I have no issues running lots of standard programs at once.-Comes with Time Machine. As an attorney and amateur photographer, I have lots of stuff that needs to be backed up regularly and reliably. Time Machine works so well and so seamlessly that I can't imagine how I survived before.-Spotlight is brilliant. Type in any word, and Spotlight almost instantly gives you results from your entire hard drive, including INSIDE your searchable documents, preferences, web results, and even definitions of words.-Seven hours of battery life is very possible, even on wireless. I can sit in Starbucks for hours unplugged and still have plenty of life left. The caveat is that you really can only surf and use programs like Word. I also have Flash installed, which is a huge battery drainer, so I grabbed a Flash-blocking program that let's me choose which Flash files to activate. Nice solution.-HD webcam. Nice quality, though I haven't really done more than messed around with it.-The magnetic power cable is slick.-As a former Windows user, I find the Mac OS X interface to be really nice and intuitive. There's obviously a learning curve, though I've found it be surprisingly short. Lion is anticipated to be a nice upgrade, too.-PRICE! Well, a lot of people complain about the Apple premium, and it definitely exists. I found this laptop to be a few hundred dollars higher than the really nice Windows laptops with mostly similar specs, although I don't think comparing raw horsepower between two different operating systems is always an accurate benchmark. I live on my computer, so I'm willing to pay a little more to get what I want. It's like buying a BMW because you have to spend three or four hours a day in your car. Whether that value equation works for you or not is up to you and your checkbook.-Anything I dislike? Not really. I'd like maybe one more USB port and a CF card reader. I'd love to start seeing cheaper SSDs in these things, but that's really not Apple's fault. Decent SSDs with any size are still expensive for everyone. I was a little nervous about having a 5400 RPM HDD. I think transferring large NEF files from the card reader might be fractionally slower. The tradeoff in battery life is probably worth it. Will Thunderbolt be worth it? Who knows? I don't care just yet, but ask me next year.I know there's more to say, but I'm running out of steam. I'm happy to discuss anything in the comments.
-	I have had this laptop for 11 months now and thank the lord I purchased the warranty! I loved it when I got it and figured that it would be the best laptop for me for school, this thing had everything I needed and more. Well purchasing this for school you would think that it would have lasted me the first semester right? well wrong, it broke down three weeks before the semester ended,I had to take it to best buy to get fixed because the screen went out, I could plug it in to the Tv and I could see everything but as we all know you cant do all your homework on Tv when others would like the tv also, I do homework every day and night all week long so this wouldn't work! so it took two weeks to fix, back in the clear and working, great! second semester 7 weeks left, I open it turn it on and its a screen with big red letters ERROR, what not again, so I call best buy and they say that's not good bring it in!! ok so I take it in and it wont turn on for them for nothing, so they have to send it away and find out the hard drive and disc drive went out! not even a year and the whole laptop had to basically be replaced. I was going to call customer support and tell them but you cant call you have to do it all online so I cant talk to a real person at all about this ! omg never again I have had to use my old pavilion HP and after five years of no problems I have just had to replace the hard drive that's it!
+	This is a great Toshiba Laptop, and it had Windows 7; the only way to go.  My third Toshiba laptop; and they just keep getting better!  Would highly recommend to anyone!  The backlit keyboard is fantastic.
+	I choose this version because it's chipper and very good to use. I'm very happy. I used in my work and it's very functional.
-	So, I bought the new Haswell 13" MBA from apple.com/my. And in less than two weeks, in an unexpected accident, someone tripped on the Mag Safe and instead of disconnecting, it pulled the MBA off the table and made a slight dent. I called Apple and was passed to customer relations and after 3 whole weeks, they refused to acknowledge this as an issue and to say that the Mag Safe 2 is working as designed. I even took a video* of how I could lift the Mac Book Air with the Mag Safe attached but it was no use.I tried to exercise my rights to return within 14 days as it is not up to my satisfaction and was refused this because, hey, in Malaysia we have no return policy (and we don't have an Apple Store to go and mess up with them). When I tried to escalate the issue, the person told me that she's customer relations and is the highest level of escalation. But yet she can't do anything. This is frustrating. What happens to "number 1 in customer satisfaction?". So beware, if you owned the Haswell model. I suspect that it is because I owned a Configure To Order model i.e. I have add-ons, which made it costly for them to replace, but that is not my problem! I'm beginning to re-think of my choice of notebook, phones, tablets in the future!*Said video:[...]===Update:Wow.. just W-O-W!The plot thickens.So I decided to post the exact same post I did above to Apple Discussion Communities([...] and guess what?

+	I love this laptop. It arrived in perfect condition. It runs well, it was clean and had only one very tiny scratch. The windows seven professional works great. It was well packed  and the box arrived with no sign of damage at all. It is lightweight and the battery life on this laptop is amazing. I LOVE THIS PURCHASE!!!
+	At first it thought $1100 for a laptop was waaaaaay to much! But after talking to a few friends whom had their macbooks for 2-3 years (i been through 2 in 2 years). I took a leap of faith and bought my first macbook pro. THE BEST INVESTMENT I EVER MADE!!! It took about a week to get used to but its well worth it! The muti-tasking dosent cause the system to slowdown at all. And after playing around with my moms HP I WILL BE A MACBOOK USER FOR A LONG TIME!!
+	Overall I'm pleased with the performance and quality of this touchscreen laptop, but I didn't give it a 5 because I don't really like the mouse pad or touch pad or whatever it's called. I use a wireless mouse and the touchscreen for most things. I think my biggest problem is that I'm a fan of desktops and I replaced my ailing desktop with this. I think it's a good laptop, but I've never been a serious laptop user.
+	I've had a good number of mac laptops over the years, and this is the best yet. Keyboard is very solid and feels good to type on, screen is bright, CPU is extremely fast. I recommend using an SSD as your boot drive. Only possible downside is I feel the colors on the screen are not quite right. This is my first glossy screen and I like the 'pop' but the colors don't seem to be as accurate as my 2006 model -- it's not exactly the color temperature, but something like that. I'm getting used to it though. Overall, I love it.
+	The color is fantastic so my pictures look better than ever.  Migration form my former mac which suffered being dropped, and was not responding was still easy. All my information, settings were the same, only much better!!!
+	Thank you for working with me to resolve the issue with warranty for this computer. I cannot wait for it to arrive and my son sees it. I’m sure he will be very happy and satisfied with the quality and condition of this computer.  I cannot tell you how refreshing it is to have a Seller that responds to every question with care, professionalism, understanding, and a will to put the customer first. I congratulate you on having employee like Jason that represents your company in that way.When I ready to buy another computer you can bet you last dollar there will not be a question on which company I have the FAITH in
-	The operation of the tablet is great. It may be slow launching apps, but truly for basic stuff I have not had any issues with it. The pen is well integrated and you can download SPEN app as well.The BIIGEST issueBattery drain during standby. There is no Hibernate mode in this device any more. I ran a battery Usage report . In the evening I left the tablet sufficiently charged. in the morning it was DRAINED!. No one touched it etc. very very annoying.the other issue is that .76 WIFI drivers from Samsung, you cannot save a hidden SSID. it will connect, but the next day you want to connect again you have to create a new profile all over again. so now I have HIDDENSSID100 of entries and  have to purge them out and recreate a new profile everytime.SYSTEM PRODUCT NAMESAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD. 500TBIOS P09AAI.348.130322.SH 03/22/20132013-05-2710:21:02 Active Battery 98 % 30,870 mWh10:25:04 Connected standby Battery 98 % 30,870 mWh2013-05-28 03:52:03 Suspended 20 % 6,300 mWh07:29:29 Active AC 7 % 2,258 mWh09:30:36 Connected standby AC 95 % 30,638 mWhRecharged as it was deadat 4pm I left it , unplugged.16:13:35 Active Battery 96 % 30,870 mWh16:24:12 Connected standby Battery 95 % 30,555 mWhnotice there is no activity shown , yet I lost most all charge2013-05-29 08:06:09 Active Battery 21 % 6,930 mWh09:10:04 ActiveAC12 %3,780 mWh
+	almost perfect in every way this MacBook Pro albeit "expensive' (ouch) does everything very, very well - curious to me that the same components in a Win7 configuration don't perform nearly as well which clearly shows why OS X is the superior OS - very pleased with this purchase
+	Its everything I expected plus some! I always wanted to make the switch to mac from pc, but never had the funds. This year I will be attending college so it was mandatory to buy a laptop. I did some research and it was final I was getting a Macbook Pro. I thought about buying the higher end model (2.2, 6750m) , but I will not be doing any heavy gaming so the base model was fine with me. So far is awesome. The glare isn't nearly as bad as people say, and the screen is the beautiful! The 500GB 5400rpm HDD is very snappy and I don't think I will be upgrading to a 7200rpm or SSD anytime soon. I think 4GB of ram is more than enough for anyone, but I may upgrade to 8GB of ram in the future. Battery life is beyond what they claim if you turn down the obvious battery drainers. (Backlight keyboard, Brightness, etc) The trackpad is ALOT better than what i thought! I may just have to buy the wireless trackpad soon. Other than those things this laptop is FAST and durable, and will be even better when Mac OS X Lion comes out in a few days.So far this what I've bought for this laptop and recommend.-Rain Mstand-Logitech Anywhere mouse-Mini Display to HDMI for dual screening with TVs-Apple Wireless Keyboard-USB Hub (Sadly it only has 2 USB ports)-Moshi Clearguard Keyboard Protector (Strongly recommended if you want to keep it looking new)
-	I ordered a Dell Latitude D600 from this seller...and what a mistake that was...when the computer arrived it was broken! it just came apart..at first the seller was trying to blame me what a joke..I just received the computer..I had to return the computer using my own money which was not cheap for them to find out that it was not assembled right. It took them another twice weeks to send me back another computer all this time I have not computer to work with after I have paid for one.After two long weeks I get the other computer delivered to me..finally I have a computer that work...so that is what I was thinking...plug it in thinking the power cord work..and my computer went dead...the power cord did not work!! so now I have a computer with no working power cord! I contacted the seller again..and he made me out to be a liar saying it was a new cord (which it was not)and I had to be joking.. he claims he would send me another one out..well that has been since August this is now Oct..and no power cord still to this day the power cord has never arrived..I can't afford to spend even one more penny to send this thing back so its seats in my closet...I have since purchase a new computer which I should have done in the first place.DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER OR YOU WILL BE SORRY YOU DID. Buy new...oh beat this...one more for the road...the "G" key is broken...and its an old computer in maybe ok shape at best..what a waste of time and money...buy new.
+	I've never bought a used computer before but I'd do it again now. There was an issue with the battery...taken care of quickly and easily! Awesome product. Perfect for what it was purchased for.
+	computer works great nice screen is great easy to use ive always have bought hp think its a good product
-	I purchased this computer in march 2011. It has already gone back to Dell twice for the same problems.... motherboards replaced both time, within 1 month of each other. My warranty is up next month, and I have a feeling I will be buying another computer soon. I asked dell to just replace the computer but they refused. The computer was gone for 2 weeks each time... a real inconvenience.
+	I purchased this computer for my wife about a year ago.  From the moment we turned it on we noticed the true difference between a PC and a MAC.  PC's are truly built for the Techy and MAC's for the rest of us.  That is not to say that MAC's are only for people that have no idea how to use a PC, they are built for those that don't know how all the code works.  Currently, we have two PC's and one MAC.  The Mac cost quite a bit more than the PC, however, we haven't had any software or hardware problems with the MAC and a host of software problems with the PC.  Furthermore, the touch pad on a MAC is superior to that on a PC.  There is no struggle to scroll down, right click, drag and drop and so on.  Also, when I purchased the MAC, it came with a free wireless printer.  The PC desktop wouldn't load the printer through the Windows auto feature because it couldn't find a suitable driver.  I had to use the disk that came with the Printer.  Not a problem, but when I started loading the software on the PC I figured I would see how it worked on a MAC.  The MAC asked me two easy questions, asked for permission to go to the HP website for the software and printed it's first test page before the PC loaded three of nine items from the disk.Overall, the MAC is superior in everything so far over the PC, but most importantly is the Operating system.  MAC's operating system seems flawless.  Quick start up and blazing speeds to include shut down or waking the system up.  Plus Apple thinks of little details, like a keyboard that knows it's dark so it lights up and then allows you to set the brightness.  You will pay more, but I think money is less important than time and the extra bucks are worth the savings in patience you will need with a PC and Windows.  However, if you are truly looking for that ability to figure out code and love to wait for Windows to consistently update and crash, save some cash and buy a PC.  You can tuck away the savings you will eventually need for relaxation therapy sessions after purchasing a PC.
+	i finally made the switch from a PC to a mac and love it!! i'm so happy! i'm not going back.  the item was delivered quickly.  everything seems to work.
+	This product is great given the price. I had it about 6 weeks and I am very happy with my purchase. The only downside is the speaker volume is too low. However, I am extremely happy otherwise. I will never spend big bucks on a laptop again!!!
-	I bought this Toshiba laptop 3 years ago and it worked great for 1.5 years. At the 1.5 year mark, the screen started to flicker and died not long after that. I had to hook it up to an external monitor and used it as a 'desktop' because I figured the repair cost was too much.  It hobbled on for another 1.5 years then died completely. I think my experience with Toshiba's poor reliability is very common, judging from reading many others' similar experience. I would never buy another Toshiba computer based on so many complaints by so many people. By the way, my 8-year-old Sony laptop is still going strong, slow but working still.
-	I give this laptop a rating of 1/5, because I have had a lot of BSOD errors since the first day I received it. I had graphic related issues and had to reinstall NVIDIA a couple times. First from NVIDIA’s website, but I still had driver errors, so I got it from MSI’s website after. I also had some issue with Killer Ethernet Service, which is actually a known issue with MSI Laptops. [...]My google chrome also kept crashing, and I found a thread where someone else had the same issue. I’m not sure if this is specifically the laptop’s fault or in google, but there was also someone else with a MSI laptop too. [...]I probably won’t be buying from MSI or Tegra again.
+	Great laptop. I am happy to have it. It is very fast and quite. Touch screen is cool and convenient.
+	I used the Mac from 1984 to 1995 at which time I switched to Windows, since I retired and was starting to work as a computer consultant and the people who needed help were all Window users. After making a good income helping Window users for over ten years, I bought an iPhone and was so impressed I decided to look into the current Macs. What a pleasant surprise. It's really a joy to again use a computer that is fun to use and you don't have to spend all that time keeping it running, as I did in Windows. I still have a need to run a few programs in Windows, such as Access, so I installed Parallels Desktop for the Mac 6 and can now use Windows when I have no other choice. The MacBook Pro 15 is without a doubt the best investment I have made in years. If you want to see what the computers of the future are going to look like checkout the last Macs.
-	After owning several problem-free Compaq and Dell laptops over the past 15 years, I made the mistake of buying my first Toshiba, a Satellite L675D. I admit that I was enthralled by the 17" display.  Big mistake. HUGE MISTAKE.  Less than four months after purchase, my wife opened the laptop one evening and the screen showed a crack in the upper right corner.  I sent the laptop to the Toshiba repair depot and they claim she accidently damaged it and they want $325 to repair it.  BTW, the entire system only cost $530 brand new.  According to Toshiba Customer Relations (and I quote) the "accident was caused by opening the case too hard".  I asked how that was even possible. Seriously, how do you open a laptop too hard? Toshiba said (and I quote), "you could have pulled too hard". If anyone from Toshiba is reading this, refer to T1-1174583 case # 110 331 001 320.  I swear these are exact quotes.  I currently own several Toshiba products, but after this experience I will never purchase another Toshiba product of any type in my lifetime. And now whenever I see someone even looking at a Toshiba laptop in Best Buy, HHGreg, WalMart, etc, I will warn them not to even consider Toshiba. Stick with manufacturers who stand behind their products. Toshiba is not one of them.
-	The laptop has worked well for me, but has has a design flaw in the hinges.  The monitor hinge has failed 2 times and I have had to wait 1 month each time while the unit was at HP for repair.  The third time the piece of plastic that the base of the hinge attaches to separated from the rest of the computer.  The hinge does not directly connect into the chassis, but is connected only to a 2"X2" piece of plastic that is held in place only by plastic tabs.  HP offers no option but at third repair trip.I would return this unit if possible because of the hinge issue.
-	This laptop is advertised at having 1GB GDDR5 NVIDIA(R) GeForce GT 630M Graphics, but instead came with an Intel HD 4000 graphics card... needless to say I AM EXTREMELY disappointed....
-	**Beware** Sony Customer Representatives are the worst.  My Vaio CW series laptop had a hard drive failure and 2 bluray failures.  They didn't seem to care and it seems that these type of failures are typical for a machine approaching its year and a half birthday.  Now they want to charge me $1066 for a machine I paid$1300 for.  I should have stuck with Toshiba - my last laptop is 5 years and still going :/
-	My wife and I have two HP DM1 computers. They were very good when they were new. We liked how small and light and easy to pack they were. Unfortunately, by the time they were a year old, they were so slow that they were unusable. I suspect that they were overheating but cooling pads did not help much. Anyway, I don't recommend these computers. You pay extra for their small size and they have just enough capacity when they are brand new. When they get a little older they don't have enough capacity.
+	Steve Jobs had returned to Apple, which had been a struggling company, and it was time to align it once again with world of creative users.  In 1997 an ad was run with actor Richard Dreyfuss reading the voiceover, which began with: "Here's to the Crazy Ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently." Think Different... that was the 1997 slogan and theme for Apple's comeback to the world of serious computing after the return of Steve Jobs, and perhaps it was a cynical reference to IBM's famous "Think" slogan.  Whatever it was, this was the ad campaign that restored Apple's reputation under the leadership of the late Steve Jobs.Take this MacBook Pro review as one from a dedicated Windows PC user who made the switch awhile ago, with time enough to put it through its paces, to do side-by-side comparisons.  I've owned a Mac before, back in the day of the Macintosh SE, and though I found it to be extremely useful for desktop publishing in the days when Aldus PageMaker reigned supreme in that area, I saw things blend as Microsoft slowly got its act together, for the most part.  When it came time to upgrade back then, I stuck with the Windows PCs... until recently, when I found the need to diversify a bit.To make this easy for those who just want to get to the facts quickly, I'll list the positive and negative points that I've personally found with the MacBook Pro first, then elaborate with details a bit further on.  Please also remember that these are coming from a satisfied Windows 7 PC user, and one with multiple computers.◆ MacBook Pro Positives:+ Well thought-out packaging, easy out of the box setup+ Excellent build quality, unparalleled detail in workmanship+ Superb aluminum unibody chassis construction, has a good solid feel+ Sharp 13.3-Inch backlit display, first-rate 1280-by-800 Resolution+ Screen display has excellent color resolution and contrast for photos+ First class backlit keyboard, easy to use in low-light situations+ Very fast boot up even with password protection enabled+ Proven Mac OS X operating system; based on UNIX (like a server)+ Built-in SD card slot; great for transferring photos to computer+ Responsive ergonomic multi-touch trackpad; no buttons, excellent cursor control+ Well-engineered 60W power adapter with decent cable management system+ Automated incremental backups with Time Machine, works with almost any external HDD◆ In Between:± Claimed 7 hour battery life; 5-6 hours is more like it, depending on the apps that you're running◆ Negatives:- No built-in HDMI or VGA output, adapters must be purchased separately- Only 2 USB 2.0 ports, and they are too close together◆ The Details:We each have our reasons for the computers that we own.  Mine were primarily to have a compact yet sturdy platform for word processing, accessing the Internet, and digital photo processing.  That stated, there's little to not like about this MacBook Pro.  The Intel Dual-Core Processor is fast and efficient, and even better than the Pentium Dual-Core 2.20GHz processor on my Windows 7 notebook PC.  It's one thing to see it in the store, but when one gets it home and takes it out of the well-designed box, it's apparent that this is a better grade computer than might have been anticipated.  The first thing that is noticed once it's unwrapped is the workmanship.  The unibody main enclosure, constructed from a single block of aluminum, is proof of this attention to detail and it helps add to its durability.The 13-inch backlit LCD display is sharp, and has the excellent color resolution and contrast that I need, especially when working with photos.  The glossy screen actually helps to see images with their full clarity.  Using both Adobe software apps and Nikon Capture NX 2, having clear and sharp resolution is an absolute necessity, and this MacBook Pro offers that.  The backlit keyboard is a pleasure to use, and quite functional in low-light mobile locations.  I'm also very impressed with the quick boot up, even with the password startup screen enabled, a security necessity when at some mobile locations.It's hard to fault OS X in any way.  This operating system is UNIX-based, and therein lays its strength, along with its ability to run 64-bit applications.  It works right out of the box without fiddling or tweaking.  It's far better than Mac OS 9 and its predecessors, and the security while on the `Net is reassuring.The tiny built-in SD card slot has proven itself to be good for transferring photos from the digital cameras to the computer.  I've also used it to transfer other media files and documents between computers in a pinch.  It took awhile to get used to the trackpad, with its so-called "multi-touch gestures," but once mastered it's easy to use.  Must admit that I do revert to using a mouse when using the computer at home... call it years of conditioning.This computer really shines with the inclusion of the Time Machine application, and I was happy to find that I could use a reasonable priced off-the-shelf hard drive to do automated incremental backups.  I have a Toshiba 500 GB USB Portable Hard Drive, and all I did was reformat it to HFS+ Journaled file system to use the Time Machine backup software.  It works like a champ.The external 60W power adapter is well engineered and keeps my computer running cooler than PC notebooks with internal power supplies.  I appreciate the magnetic DC connector as it pops off easily if some klutz trips on the cord, necessitating a costly repair as I found out when someone did that to one of my PC notebooks.  The LED in the connector head helps: amber it's charging, green it's charged; very simple and effective.◆ Other Notes:The battery life being less than advertised I can live with.  I would have expected HDMI and/or VGA output to be built-ins with a computer of this quality.  But I have yet to buy the adapters.  But to have only two built-in USB 2.0 ports is irritating, and those are too close together.  Problem solved with an external 4-port ISB adapter, so that issue is closed.I have had issues with laptop carrying bags in the past, and now carry my MacBook Pro in a ThinkTank Artificial Intelligence 15 V. 2.0 Laptop Bag.  I picked this one over many others from heavy experience with photo gear, and know that Think Tank makes exceptionally good pro gear.  It protects my computer from the elements quite well, holds more gear than I can explain here (I have reviewed it), and can highly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect their MacBook with the kind of case that it really deserves.Browser note: I've used the included Safari browser, but my de-facto standard remains Google Chrome.  Safari is a decent browser, but because I find it necessary to synchronize my email on the Mac, the PCs and even one older Linux-based notebook (it's a geek/support thing), Chromes just works better, and I find it faster.  Your experiences may differ, so try whichever works for you.I'm running Office for Mac 2011 and have found its interface to be even better than Microsoft Office 2010 or 2007 on the PC.  Didn't know if the implementation of Outlook for Mac 2011 would be better than Entourage, which was buggy, but Outlook turned out to be excellent, and it's become my mainstay over the PC version.Heat is an issue that I had heard of by some, yet I have not experienced.  The heat level is better than my old HP, Compaq or Dell, and far better than my VAIO (which was very bad).  The only one that has been better heat-wise is my current ASUS notebook running Windows 7, but not by much.  Had been tempted to get a keyboard skin for general protection in the field, but heard that these interfere with the ventilation, so that idea has been tabled for the present.◆ Future:I may upgrade to 8GB of RAM, which has been recommended by a number of people if and when system performance issues arise.  The RAM upgrades are quite reasonable, but I'm pleasantly surprised at how well it runs with the standard 4 GB at this point.◆ [Updated 3/10/2014]This MacBook Pro has been in continuous use for over two years now. In the summer of 2012 I did the memory upgrade to 8GB of RAM using the Crucial 8GB (4GBx2) Kit in anticipation of the OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) release. Detailed notes of what I did can be found on my review of that Crucial 8GB kit, which my be helpful to first-timers. Have also been doing the OS X upgrades, usually about 2 - 3 weeks after they were released to see what bugs may have been encountered. Currently the computer is running the OS X 10.9.2 (Mavericks) update, and though I went through some hiccups with the initial OS X 10.9 release, OS X 10.9.2 has been running fine on this computer.Am using the Time Machine backup software application in conjunction with a Seagate Expansion 1TB Portable External USB 3.0 Hard Drive which has been partitioned; one segment is for automatic backups, and the other segment is reserved for manually saving photo, MP3 and video files. The main thing is to let the Time Machine do your backups automatically as a security measure.◆ In Conclusion...I could say more, but the best advice that I can offer is that if you get a MacBook Pro, regardless of which model, take it out of the box, plug it in and charge it.  After that, turn it on and see how easy it can be... the MacBook Pro just works, as you'll see.  Think Different is a reality, and this one proves it.JW ▪ 1/30/2012; Updated 3/10/2014
-	between main body and ground panel, It is made a gap. This gap make a noise because there is a hole.
+	I saw this laptop on monday evening and I decided to email the seller because I needed the laptop by friday. I was so amazed by the speed he replied. He gave me all the informations I needed and he guaranteed me that if I order on tuesday I ll get it by friday. What I did. I was also surprised by the price. Could this be true???Anyway I decided to give it a try. Right now am so happy I made that choice the laptop was delivered on thursday everything work perfectly. I ll be able fo study for my exam. I 100% recommend this seller ( I even get a laptop bag for free). I surely will continue to buy from him. The laptop is like new and runs fast. Am happy!!!
-	This compact laptop packs one hell of a punch. Though I am still getting used to Windows 8, I use this computer for everything. It is replacing my 15.6 inch Gateway laptop. The touchscreen is a plus. For me 2GB of RAM is sufficient so far, and there is plenty of room for storage on the 320GB hard drive. I must say I am impressed with this laptop so far and would definitely recommend to a friend. I am glad my husband convinced me to jump on the Gateway wagon!!!UPDATE 3 Weeks LaterI was really was really enjoying this laptop until it conked out on me. I went to log on and after I entered my password, the screen would turn blue and stay that way. I tried rebooting it, recharging it, and I even took the battery out, all to no avail. Hence, I returned it today and reduce my rating from five stars to one star. I should have known not to purchase the first release of an item since the manufacturer probably has more kinks to work out. Hope this helps.
-	I have no idea how this has an average rating of 4 stars or how I have not smashed it to pieces yet.  Suitable for a child or occasional browsing if you don't mind loading time. I'm giving mine away. If you want a real laptop, this is not one.
+	I'm giving this laptop five stars because after using it for a week, I have yet to find something to criticize.  I paid $1049 at BestBuy, and they included in the deal the box for wirless streaming to your TV, which works well.  One of the things that made this laptop stand out for me among all the choices in the store was the keyboard.  Very comfortable to use, reminded me of the MacBook keyboards.  The laptop is light, the screen colors seem great, and the computer itself looks pretty good and doesn't feel cheap.  I do think that the speakers are a bit weak and tinny, but I was not expecting anything more than this.  So, in summary, I got what I paid for-- a powerful, well rounded, lightweight laptop.
-	Purchased this laptop for my son to use while away at college. The mouse pad on the lap top stopped working within the first month that he had the laptop.  Now the laptop cannot be charged.  I contacted the seller and they pretty much belittled me and my attempt to get a replacement.  DO NOT  purchase anything from this seller, unless you want to be treated with total disdain.
-	I purchased this computer for my wife for Christmas.  It arrived quickly so I wrapped it and put it under the tree.  Christmas morning she opened it and it wouldn't load.  I spent an hour on the phone with HP tech support.  They verified the hard drive was bad, and offered to replace it.  Told them I would deal with Amazon.  I'll probably just exchange it for the same thing and try my luck.  Very disappointing, especially on Christmas morning.
+	My new or refurbished Dell Latitude D620 has delivered better than expected.  This computer is fast for everyday computing and was offered at a fantastic pricepoint.  I was a little leary of buying a rebuilt computer from a company I did'nt know but Tampa Laptops delivered quickly and in like new condition.  A very durable laptop and great price under $250.00,  and a much better machine than my older Dell D610.
+	The computer was as described and in better condition than I thought. Thank You for a great product and a smooth transaction.
+	I just ordered my very first MacBook pro today.  My friend gave me the black macbook from late 2006 and it's on it's last legs.  That was my first introduction to OS X and I'm in love. Everything about Apple's OS and their equipment is so elegant and easy to use.  I was a die hard PC user for the past 10 years but now I don't think I will ever go back.  There was always things I wished I could do on my PC but for some reason wasn't allowed or couldn't figure it out.  With OS X, I can do everything that I want and do it relatively easy.  Apple products are very pricey but, you definitely get what you pay for.I decided to go with the 13" MBP because it fit better into my budget and the portability of it.  I wanted a machine that could perform when watching HD videos, doing some light video/photo editing, playing some games every now and again, as well as doing my daily work (word processing, email, web browsing, etc..).  I travel quite a bit and this was definitely the machine that fit me.  I imagine I will eventually add an SSD and upgrade the RAM but, coming from a 6 year old MacBook to this, I'm sure I will be very satisfied.
-	I brought the computer as an anniversary present to my husband. I was highly disappointed that the computer did not work properly. I will never order electronics from Amazon again.
-	I ordered was a notebook with an I7-4500 CPU and 1TB hard drive and instead I got a I7-3537 CPU with a 500GB hard drive.Liar !!!
-	I purchased las month  this MacBook and It does not working well. a) I can't Upgrade the Software b) turning off alone.
-	My wife bought a green one because she liked the color and style.  Yes, it is stylish and lightweight, and easy to carry (fits perfectly into her favorite handbag!).  But every time I use it, I get so frustrated with its slow speed that I want to just toss this thing out the window.  Apparently there is no system malfunction, applications are kept to minimal, and the power-saving mode is set to high performance (at the expense of battery hours), but it is still too slow.  Small notebooks coming out of Taiwan in recent years cost less than 1/2 of this unit, and they are more than twice as fast.  If you are looking to make a fashion statement, then go for this Vaio.  If you are after a lightweight notebook that is practical and functional, then stay away.
-	I have an 8month old inspirion 1525 and it has a host of issues.  The screen has a black spot and the resolution went out and is wobbly and unusable, the ac adapter overheats and sparks, the laptop itself overheats, the battery won't work even though it has a full charge and is unchargeable.  Dell support is saying that there is a crack in the screen and it's my fault and is now being transferred to their 'holding' department which is basically the place computers go when the warranty is not being honored.  No mention of the ac adapter and when I asked they just said that the computer will be in the hold department tomorrow and gave me a number to call and check in .  I expect I will have to spend more time and energy defending myself from their defective product.  Lastly, I've been researching the complaints and all that I've stated have been complained about many times over.  I wish I read the reviews BEFORE purchasing.  I have a Dell home computer which has never given me any issues and I've had it for 7 years.  I guess I expected the same quality from the laptop.  Live and Learn-----yeah right a scam is a scam! I'm going to research to see if there is any class action law suits.  I'm not the suing kind but it seems to be the only way for me and many, many others to be heard!!
+	I purchased this laptop for travelling and have been very pleased with its performance and its ease of use, I was not sure about Linux but am very happy. Would recommend to others.
-	First Of all, Ordered from the Lenovo.  Took it almost 3-4 weeks for delivery.When I open the box..It looks cool < But as soon as i turn-on the unit. was OK and start making fan noise( when i pick up the unit or change shape as tablet..).Called tech-Support, The Tech. Support person heard it and issued ticket number transfer my call to post sales department.Hung-up, and called customer service again, hung-up again while transfer, same happen 3 times, every time call themwaiting about 5 min at-least. Finally tried web chat, it worked but the agent didn't help me out at all, she told me they will issuereturn label and RMA number within Five hours.. ( % hours.. OMG!).. been waiting a day.. didn't get it.So had to call them back, this time finally can talk with real person, told me nothing in record didn't processed.. and he issuesreturn label.. within few min. i got an email for return process. I sent it thru UPS, and they received 5 days ago. my money is still not refunded. and i got an email abut lenovo customer care person, say sorry and they will review this case and update to me asap. didn't happen for 5 days, i've just sent an email for update .. same answer" we'll update you asap..."what 's wrong with them?
+	its working very good, nice laptop Asus G74SX-BBK7 17.3" Notebook (2.0GHz Intel Core i7-2630QM Processor, 8 GB...thank youbye bye
+	Bought a desktop and decided to try the laptop.  So easy to use, and no nasty viruses!  I won't go back to a regular PC.
+	I did much research on laptops and I was looking for a workhorse with Windows 7  for my use.  I am not a gamer and this fit the bill for a home unit that I don't take out too often; As I wait for the second generation of windows 8 ultra thins or tablets to shake out the bugs.This unit is tough, fast, reliable and good looking.
-	I work in the computer field and very experienced in trouble shooting software problems. Despite very light usage, the computer keyboard failed within 4 four months of the purchase. Among the alpha keys only four or five keys works. I tried to fix the problem by uninstalling the keyboard driver and also  by restoring the system, but nothing helped. I do not recommend this laptop.
-	This laptop is good but it isn't great, the pointing stick is really sensitive, and the keyboard is really easy to adjust to, but it is very easy to leave fingerprints on the cover; nonetheless, this is good machine.The US version comes with the Intel Atom 1.33GHz, but the Japanese version as well as the ones in Hong Kong come with the option of choosing Intel Z520 1.33GHz, Z530 1.6GHz, and Z540 1.86GHz. Once again the US isn't getting the "right" stuff, for some reason US will also have this lag in presenting us the product we wanted. I also asked one of the sales representative, and he says there will be an upgraded version in US, but it's going to take awhile, so don't waste your money now and wait for the upgrades or you could choose to buy the Japanese version, which is available in many websites.
-	This laptop has the worst touch-pad ever, only 2 hours battery and bad speakers. I bought the laptop then returned it a week later.
-	First off, this laptop is a wonderful beast. If you've looked at the specs, it should be obvious it is a phenomenal product on the inside plus a very desirable 1920x1080 super-bright display, extremely loud speaker system, back-lit keyboard, backward-facing exhaust vents (this was a huge bonus for me), etc.I'm still very in love with this thing because it offers all the feature and more than I was hoping I could find in a single laptop. In fact, it doesn't seem there's any other laptop on the market with equivalent specs. The speed, power, and useability make this a dream machine.All that said, I've been sorely disappointed with some persistent hardware malfunctioning. The wifi adapter very frequently drops its connection for no apparent reason whatsoever. By "very frequently" I mean I normally can retain a connection for up to 5-10 minutes before it disconnects for about 30 seconds then reconnects. All other devices on my LAN have no connectivity problems, so I know it's just the laptop. I also tried using the ethernet adapter to mitigate this issue, but the odd thing is the same thing happens with that. This might not be a noticeable problem to some, but I imagine it would be an annoyance to most, especially since this is a gaming notebook. (I have never done any gaming on it, however. I often use it for work which involves using persistent SSH connections to remote servers all day and night.)The other hardware problem is that the trackpad horribly malfunctions. At first it just started moving the mouse in strange places or zooming in/out unexpectedly or clicking when I'm trying to just move the cursor or by not moving at all. Then after a while, the trackpad and its buttons just stopped working altogether. I mean they were completely nonfunctional.I love the machine a lot despite the connectivity issue, and so much so that I even purchased a USB wifi adapter to use on the laptop. But those things are pretty flaky as well and once the trackpad was busted, I considered returning the thing, however I was well beyond Amazon's return policy would allow.I started an RMA with Asus via their website. I just had to provide the serial number, purchase date information, etc. and a tech support person emailed me to troubleshoot. When installing all the firmware updates he recommended didn't make a lick of difference, they had me ship it via FedEx to their repair center (on their dime, of course).I received it back under a week later with only a strange single sheet of paper inside the box. It lists a bunch of checkboxes for possible repairs they could have made and only "Replaced LCD Monitor" was checked. How odd. I didn't know how replacing the monitor could fix the ethernet adapter, wifi adapter, and trackpad, but I cracked the thing open and gave it a whirl. To my surprise, all seemed keen... for a little while.I was a happy camper. I had the perfect laptop I knew this bad boy could be. I left some SSH connections open as a test for over 48 hours and they never disconnected. Using the trackpad is always accurate.Now here I sit 2 months later and all the same problems have returned. I phoned their tech support line and they opened a new RMA for me and I'll be sending it back in for in-depth repairs tomorrow. I'm hoping for a better, more permanent outcome this go-'round. Will update this review with any new info I have.As an aside, I'm not sure why people have had given so many horrible reviews of Asus' tech support. I've dealt with them via email and over the phone and I've never had any problems with them. They seem to be pretty responsive to me.Oct 24, 2011 UPDATE: ===========================To update the status of my laptop, I sent it in the second time and they replaced the wifi board and the trackpad. Upon starting to use it, the wifi disconnection problem was worse than ever, dropping my connection every 2 minutes. Plus, the trackpad they put in had a broken left mouse button that made no physical click and you'd have to pound to make it execute a click.I sent it back in for the third time about a week later. I received it back from this 3rd RMA about 10 days later. This time they replaced the hard drive, wifi board, trackpad, and LCD panel. I didn't have much time to test my wifi connection because soon as I turned it on, I realized they must've put the wrong LCD panel on because I could not achieve my previous maximum resolution of 1920x1080.The very same day I received it, I spent about a few hours updating Windows and all the drivers and another hour on the phone with tech support starting my 4th RMA. I sent it out the following morning and am still waiting on getting it back for the fourth time...This just isn't right. At the very least, one tech support fellow informed that if I return it one or two more times for the same issue, they will send it back to headquarters and give me a new one... So, now I'm hoping it will continue not working for me.It's an incredible machine and it's far superior to any laptop I've ever used or owned in every regard, except for these manufacturer defects that seemingly can't be resolved.
-	I have had this laptop for almost two years now.. and having problems. when the powercord gets plugged in i get a message connected but not charging. i have to unplug and reboot and finally it will start charging. i called support several times, they had me update the software first.. this did not help. i kept getting the run around, they could not print a label for shipping it back at the time and they would return my call.. which they did would do.. i kept calling and well then it was a year old and i was going to have to pay. now the ethernet port does not work.. and when i close the lid sometimes when i come back the light is on and i can see the screen glowing even though it is closed. i have to sign back in and put it to sleep. i am not happy with this and should not be having these problems. i have to get my old lap top out now if my router stops working and i have to connect with a cable. when i have the money i will go back to what I had before.
+	Amazon had a sale on the refreshed MacBook Pros even after Cyber Monday, so I picked one up. It arrived in 3-4 days, and is exactly what the reviews of the late 2011 MBP say it is. It's for my wife and just hassle-free computing, and it delivers on that promise, with all the bonuses and missing parts of OSX.This is really a review of Amazon. If you like the device, it ships just like from Apple.Only caveat, their free shipping doesn't require a signature, so UPS left it in front of my door while I was traveling for work. Yeah.
+	It's my first Mac, I must emphasize its accessibility and usefulness of its applications, such as speed of response to the instructions.
+	I have never had the interest to play videogames on a computer thats why i think mac works the best for me since it cant really handle all those games to play on a computer. If you like making movies and photo editing mac is the way to go. Best laptop i have ever had in my life now i have a 15inch MacBook Pro and a 13inch MacBook Pro.
+	Good for gaming and school work. Computer is as described... had windows 8. Good product for the price. the end
+	My brother really enjoys this laptop. He likes the way the home screen looks and the graphics for gaming. However, the picture appears as a grey silver color but we received a metallic purple one. The one we ordered was sold by Amazon. So Amazon, please get your customers' orders correct In the future.
+	This is my second MB Pro, I just love my first one so much that I got another to take to work instead of the old tower units. Tired of all the constant updates and slow computer. Really should have started with Mac along time ago.
-	Cannot recommend this laptop! As a physician, I have been using this device for my electronic medical records system which relies on wifi. The connection spontaneously drops 20-30 times a day which has resulted in significant data loss and subsequent data re entry hassles (imagine inputting your entire physical exam and hitting save only to have the wifi connection drop and being unable to get the page back without refreshing it).  Have chatted with HP support multiple times and have replaced the WLAN module with zero improvement. Now waiting to return it to HP for further repairs.  My network works perfectly for every other device with zero dropped connections.
+	We have a Latitude computer,, it is the E5400. It was givenn to my son to use with his school work. We have had it all school year. Because of it's durabliity and size we have just started using it as our home computer. It is 11:54 pm and I am online looking to see how much it would cost to replace this computer. I have to give it back tomorrow and I dont want to. We have nine children all have touched/used this computer over the last nine months nad it is in amazing condition. It has wonderful keys. I just really like it. And if I can afford one I will be getting one.. or perhaps two. Really no joke. it has not crashed nor has it been repaired. We have had not one problem with it. I would  highly recomend this computer. Really I will miss it a lot.
+	As a previous Windows user (11+ years), I was a little skeptical switching to Mac. However, due to my new career in photography, this was a must! I'm so highly impressed with this computer -- automatic updates, no pop-ups, no virus problems, and I don't have to wait an hour to restart the system! It was a little difficult for me to fork out the extra cash, but I'm so glad I did! No regrets whatsoever--I'm totally sold on Mac!
-	The port where the charger plugs in broke on me only 6 weeks after getting the computer!!!! Steer clear! This is an expensive piece of junk! Update. So lenovo is trying to blame me for the plastic piece that broke off my charger... I find this odd because all I did was disconnect it from a table it was sitting on and when I pulled it out, out came a small plastic piece. I am planning to take them to small claims for this. I have had my Mac for 7 years, not one thing broke on it and it came with me to college! I am really disappointed that this ultra book already broke on me and I haven't even taken it out of my house. Update. They ended up fixing my computer because I made a big to do about it. I really regret not buying another Mac. At least their computers are durable and they have great customer service when you need anything fixed. I am not looking forward to using this computer for my master's degree. I feel like it is so fragile and I can't take it anywhere (which defeats the purpose of purchasing a laptop). Buyer beware. Update. I received my computer back with a dent where the port goes. Great, I have to resend it in!! How inconvenient! I am glad school hasn't started yet.
-	Please do your research before you purchase any Lenovo products, their customer service is not the best, the design of this particular laptop, has an inherent flaw, with the screen hinge.  After 1 year of purchasing this unit the hinge broke out of the case, and you then would have to send the whole unit back to Lenovo, to have it repaired.I have used Dell for year and never had any such problems, so I am selling this units and getting a DELL.
-	Bought it brand new from best buy and having this issue of computer going to sleep and requiring a force shut down to bring it back.I have lost hours of my valuable work because of this issue. I hate it.Look at the videos.Black Screen Of Death (BSOD)[...][...][...][...]This is ridiculous. Apple knows this issue and isn't doing anything to fix. Its been more than 3 months since I reported it to apple and no solution yet. I can't get my money back not get it replaced.
-	Excellent laptop, But, the keyboard skips letters typed and also inserts double letters of some typed. Typing is very frustrating.Toshiba hasn't fixed the problem in 6 months... they say they are on the verge of fixing it.There are a lot of people wishing they had never bought the computer... you may want to hold off until it is fixed or buy from a different brand.You can check out the forum on Toshiba's website to see what aggrivation they have caused their customers:[...]Think twice before buying...
-	Gee, where do I start?1. Right out the box for the first time, there was a big scratch mark half way across the touch pad, that should ring the bell at that moment, but I thought if it's the only problem, I'll just suck it up.2. The OS was Windows 7, NOT Window 8 as they descried on Amazon. So I contacted seller, they said they could send me a product key for myself to upgrade it to the Windows 8. I felt it was a little iffy, so I took a $75 refund instead. If that was the only thing I had to suck up again, I'd be still cool with it.3. There was no Intel Wireless Display installed! I tried to download and install it online from Intel's website myself, and it kept saying "the platform is not compatible with Intel WiDi..." Now that's the red flag- if the processors are 3rd generation Intel i5 like the seller advertised, there is no way the platform wouldn't be compatible with Intel WiDi. So I ran a Intel's software "Intel system identifier" to see what actually is inside the laptop, guess what, Intel software could not identify the system!4. I called the Dell customer service today (April 7, 2014), after providing the service tag, they told me this laptop is a "REFURBISHED"!! NOT "brand new" as the seller described on Amazon and reassured me in the email they sent me! And there's another person's name attached to this laptop, until I'm able to confirm I'm the owner of the laptop, they are not going to do anything for me! By the way, I was also told if I had upgraded the system OS with the key they provided, the laptop would lose its factory warranty automatically.I am SO sending it back, not only it's a bad laptop, seems to me there are legal issues involved... To say the least, the seller deliberately lies to its customers! I will not recommend this laptop nor the seller to anyone!! Stay away!!!
+	This laptop with Ubuntu 12.04 is great.  There's a learning curve but nothing too extensive.  There are tons of info including videos on how to use the Linux software on the net.I had a problem with my wifi dropping so upgraded to 12.10, and that seems to be working better.  If it doesn't I'll upgrade to 13.04.I like ASUS products and wanted to use a non-Windows-Apple-Android OS.  I use and have used open source programs so that wasn't a big switch for me either.
-	After loading Microsoft Office Professional 2010 + Microsoft Security Essentials I began receiving messages from Microsoft that the version of Windows 7 was not authentic and that Security Essentials would shut down in 30 days in addition to automatic updates all failing. A little phrase above the time on the lower right of the screen appeared and stayed there: "not an authentic version of Windows 7". Since I had already loaded MS office professional 2010(a very expensive program)I was forced to buy an authentic version of Windows 7-and load the authentic product key- BRINGING THE TOTAL COST TO WELL OVER $400.Over a month later this PC is full of qwirks.DONT BUY FROM DISHONEST SELLERS LIKE THESE PEOPLECOMMUNICATIONS WITH THE SELLER REVEALED THAT HE IS BARELY LITERATE.The Amazon claim process is 99.9% automated and individual issues are not well addressed.I would not want to return a pc after I loaded MS office and was forced to buy an authentic version of Windows 7. That would be returning a much more valuable product than the one I bought.I requested a refund for the authentic version of Windows 7. The automated return process is not set up for specific requests and only offered a return.ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH IT!!!!
